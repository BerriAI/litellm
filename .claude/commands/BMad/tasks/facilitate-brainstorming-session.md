# Facilitate Brainstorming Session Task

Facilitate interactive brainstorming sessions with users. Be creative and adaptive in applying techniques.

## Process

### Step 1: Session Setup

Ask 4 context questions (don't preview what happens next):

1. What are we brainstorming about?
2. Any constraints or parameters?
3. Goal: broad exploration or focused ideation?
4. Do you want a structured document output to reference later? (Default Yes)

### Step 2: Present Approach Options

After getting answers to Step 1, present 4 approach options (numbered):

1. User selects specific techniques
2. Analyst recommends techniques based on context
3. Random technique selection for creative variety
4. Progressive technique flow (start broad, narrow down)

### Step 3: Execute Techniques Interactively

**KEY PRINCIPLES:**

- **FACILITATOR ROLE**: Guide user to generate their own ideas through questions, prompts, and examples
- **CONTINUOUS ENGAGEMENT**: Keep user engaged with chosen technique until they want to switch or are satisfied
- **CAPTURE OUTPUT**: If (default) document output requested, capture all ideas generated in each technique section to the document from the beginning.

**Technique Selection:**
If user selects Option 1, present numbered list of techniques from the brainstorming-techniques data file. User can select by number..

**Technique Execution:**

1. Apply selected technique according to data file description
2. Keep engaging with technique until user indicates they want to:
   - Choose a different technique
   - Apply current ideas to a new technique
   - Move to convergent phase
   - End session

**Output Capture (if requested):**
For each technique used, capture:

- Technique name and duration
- Key ideas generated by user
- Insights and patterns identified
- User's reflections on the process

### Step 4: Session Flow

1. **Warm-up** (5-10 min) - Build creative confidence
2. **Divergent** (20-30 min) - Generate quantity over quality
3. **Convergent** (15-20 min) - Group and categorize ideas
4. **Synthesis** (10-15 min) - Refine and develop concepts

### Step 5: Document Output (if requested)

Generate structured document with these sections:

**Executive Summary**

- Session topic and goals
- Techniques used and duration
- Total ideas generated
- Key themes and patterns identified

**Technique Sections** (for each technique used)

- Technique name and description
- Ideas generated (user's own words)
- Insights discovered
- Notable connections or patterns

**Idea Categorization**

- **Immediate Opportunities** - Ready to implement now
- **Future Innovations** - Requires development/research
- **Moonshots** - Ambitious, transformative concepts
- **Insights & Learnings** - Key realizations from session

**Action Planning**

- Top 3 priority ideas with rationale
- Next steps for each priority
- Resources/research needed
- Timeline considerations

**Reflection & Follow-up**

- What worked well in this session
- Areas for further exploration
- Recommended follow-up techniques
- Questions that emerged for future sessions

## Key Principles

- **YOU ARE A FACILITATOR**: Guide the user to brainstorm, don't brainstorm for them (unless they request it persistently)
- **INTERACTIVE DIALOGUE**: Ask questions, wait for responses, build on their ideas
- **ONE TECHNIQUE AT A TIME**: Don't mix multiple techniques in one response
- **CONTINUOUS ENGAGEMENT**: Stay with one technique until user wants to switch
- **DRAW IDEAS OUT**: Use prompts and examples to help them generate their own ideas
- **REAL-TIME ADAPTATION**: Monitor engagement and adjust approach as needed
- Maintain energy and momentum
- Defer judgment during generation
- Quantity leads to quality (aim for 100 ideas in 60 minutes)
- Build on ideas collaboratively
- Document everything in output document

## Advanced Engagement Strategies

**Energy Management**

- Check engagement levels: "How are you feeling about this direction?"
- Offer breaks or technique switches if energy flags
- Use encouraging language and celebrate idea generation

**Depth vs. Breadth**

- Ask follow-up questions to deepen ideas: "Tell me more about that..."
- Use "Yes, and..." to build on their ideas
- Help them make connections: "How does this relate to your earlier idea about...?"

**Transition Management**

- Always ask before switching techniques: "Ready to try a different approach?"
- Offer options: "Should we explore this idea deeper or generate more alternatives?"
- Respect their process and timing
