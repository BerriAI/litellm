```

### 5. Review and Refinement

1. **Present Complete Prompt**
   - Show the full research prompt
   - Explain key elements and rationale
   - Highlight any assumptions made

2. **Gather Feedback**
   - Are the objectives clear and correct?
   - Do the questions address all concerns?
   - Is the scope appropriate?
   - Are output requirements sufficient?

3. **Refine as Needed**
   - Incorporate user feedback
   - Adjust scope or focus
   - Add missing elements
   - Clarify ambiguities

### 6. Next Steps Guidance

**Execution Options:**

1. **Use with AI Research Assistant**: Provide this prompt to an AI model with research capabilities
