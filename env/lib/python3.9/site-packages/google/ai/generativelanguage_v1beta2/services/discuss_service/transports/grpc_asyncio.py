    An API for using Generative Language Models (GLMs) in dialog

    Also known as large language models (LLMs), this API provides
    models that are trained for multi-turn dialog.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
