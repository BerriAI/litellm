# BMAD™ Knowledge Base

## Overview

BMAD-METHOD™ (Breakthrough Method of Agile AI-driven Development) is a framework that combines AI agents with Agile development methodologies. The v4 system introduces a modular architecture with improved dependency management, bundle optimization, and support for both web and IDE environments.

### Key Features

- **Modular Agent System**: Specialized AI agents for each Agile role
- **Build System**: Automated dependency resolution and optimization
- **Dual Environment Support**: Optimized for both web UIs and IDEs
- **Reusable Resources**: Portable templates, tasks, and checklists
- **Slash Command Integration**: Quick agent switching and control

### When to Use BMad

- **New Projects (Greenfield)**: Complete end-to-end development
- **Existing Projects (Brownfield)**: Feature additions and enhancements
- **Team Collaboration**: Multiple roles working together
- **Quality Assurance**: Structured testing and validation
- **Documentation**: Professional PRDs, architecture docs, user stories

## How BMad Works

### The Core Method

BMad transforms you into a "Vibe CEO" - directing a team of specialized AI agents through structured workflows. Here's how:

1. **You Direct, AI Executes**: You provide vision and decisions; agents handle implementation details
2. **Specialized Agents**: Each agent masters one role (PM, Developer, Architect, etc.)
3. **Structured Workflows**: Proven patterns guide you from idea to deployed code
4. **Clean Handoffs**: Fresh context windows ensure agents stay focused and effective

### The Two-Phase Approach

#### Phase 1: Planning (Web UI - Cost Effective)

- Use large context windows (Gemini's 1M tokens)
- Generate comprehensive documents (PRD, Architecture)
- Leverage multiple agents for brainstorming
- Create once, use throughout development

#### Phase 2: Development (IDE - Implementation)

- Shard documents into manageable pieces
- Execute focused SM → Dev cycles
- One story at a time, sequential progress
- Real-time file operations and testing

### The Development Loop

```text
1. SM Agent (New Chat) → Creates next story from sharded docs
2. You → Review and approve story
3. Dev Agent (New Chat) → Implements approved story
4. QA Agent (New Chat) → Reviews and refactors code
5. You → Verify completion
6. Repeat until epic complete
```

### Why This Works

- **Context Optimization**: Clean chats = better AI performance
- **Role Clarity**: Agents don't context-switch = higher quality
- **Incremental Progress**: Small stories = manageable complexity
- **Human Oversight**: You validate each step = quality control
- **Document-Driven**: Specs guide everything = consistency

## Getting Started

### Quick Start Options

#### Option 1: Web UI

**Best for**: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini users who want to start immediately

1. Navigate to `dist/teams/`
2. Copy `team-fullstack.txt` content
3. Create new Gemini Gem or CustomGPT
4. Upload file with instructions: "Your critical operating instructions are attached, do not break character as directed"
5. Type `/help` to see available commands

#### Option 2: IDE Integration

**Best for**: Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, Trae, Cline, Roo Code, Github Copilot users

```bash
# Interactive installation (recommended)
npx bmad-method install
```

**Installation Steps**:

- Choose "Complete installation"
- Select your IDE from supported options:
  - **Cursor**: Native AI integration
  - **Claude Code**: Anthropic's official IDE
  - **Windsurf**: Built-in AI capabilities
  - **Trae**: Built-in AI capabilities
  - **Cline**: VS Code extension with AI features
  - **Roo Code**: Web-based IDE with agent support
  - **GitHub Copilot**: VS Code extension with AI peer programming assistant

**Note for VS Code Users**: BMAD-METHOD™ assumes when you mention "VS Code" that you're using it with an AI-powered extension like GitHub Copilot, Cline, or Roo. Standard VS Code without AI capabilities cannot run BMad agents. The installer includes built-in support for Cline and Roo.

**Verify Installation**:

- `.bmad-core/` folder created with all agents
- IDE-specific integration files created
- All agent commands/rules/modes available

**Remember**: At its core, BMAD-METHOD™ is about mastering and harnessing prompt engineering. Any IDE with AI agent support can use BMad - the framework provides the structured prompts and workflows that make AI development effective

### Environment Selection Guide

**Use Web UI for**:

- Initial planning and documentation (PRD, architecture)
- Cost-effective document creation (especially with Gemini)
- Brainstorming and analysis phases
- Multi-agent consultation and planning

**Use IDE for**:

- Active development and coding
- File operations and project integration
- Document sharding and story management
- Implementation workflow (SM/Dev cycles)

**Cost-Saving Tip**: Create large documents (PRDs, architecture) in web UI, then copy to `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md` in your project before switching to IDE for development.

### IDE-Only Workflow Considerations

**Can you do everything in IDE?** Yes, but understand the tradeoffs:

**Pros of IDE-Only**:

- Single environment workflow
- Direct file operations from start
- No copy/paste between environments
- Immediate project integration

**Cons of IDE-Only**:

- Higher token costs for large document creation
- Smaller context windows (varies by IDE/model)
- May hit limits during planning phases
- Less cost-effective for brainstorming

**Using Web Agents in IDE**:

- **NOT RECOMMENDED**: Web agents (PM, Architect) have rich dependencies designed for large contexts
- **Why it matters**: Dev agents are kept lean to maximize coding context
- **The principle**: "Dev agents code, planning agents plan" - mixing breaks this optimization

**About bmad-master and bmad-orchestrator**:

- **bmad-master**: CAN do any task without switching agents, BUT...
- **Still use specialized agents for planning**: PM, Architect, and UX Expert have tuned personas that produce better results
- **Why specialization matters**: Each agent's personality and focus creates higher quality outputs
- **If using bmad-master/orchestrator**: Fine for planning phases, but...

**CRITICAL RULE for Development**:

- **ALWAYS use SM agent for story creation** - Never use bmad-master or bmad-orchestrator
- **ALWAYS use Dev agent for implementation** - Never use bmad-master or bmad-orchestrator
- **Why this matters**: SM and Dev agents are specifically optimized for the development workflow
- **No exceptions**: Even if using bmad-master for everything else, switch to SM → Dev for implementation

**Best Practice for IDE-Only**:

1. Use PM/Architect/UX agents for planning (better than bmad-master)
2. Create documents directly in project
3. Shard immediately after creation
4. **MUST switch to SM agent** for story creation
5. **MUST switch to Dev agent** for implementation
6. Keep planning and coding in separate chat sessions

## Core Configuration (core-config.yaml)

**New in V4**: The `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` file is a critical innovation that enables BMad to work seamlessly with any project structure, providing maximum flexibility and backwards compatibility.

### What is core-config.yaml?

This configuration file acts as a map for BMad agents, telling them exactly where to find your project documents and how they're structured. It enables:

- **Version Flexibility**: Work with V3, V4, or custom document structures
- **Custom Locations**: Define where your documents and shards live
- **Developer Context**: Specify which files the dev agent should always load
- **Debug Support**: Built-in logging for troubleshooting

### Key Configuration Areas

#### PRD Configuration

- **prdVersion**: Tells agents if PRD follows v3 or v4 conventions
- **prdSharded**: Whether epics are embedded (false) or in separate files (true)
- **prdShardedLocation**: Where to find sharded epic files
- **epicFilePattern**: Pattern for epic filenames (e.g., `epic-{n}*.md`)

#### Architecture Configuration

- **architectureVersion**: v3 (monolithic) or v4 (sharded)
- **architectureSharded**: Whether architecture is split into components
- **architectureShardedLocation**: Where sharded architecture files live

#### Developer Files

- **devLoadAlwaysFiles**: List of files the dev agent loads for every task
- **devDebugLog**: Where dev agent logs repeated failures
- **agentCoreDump**: Export location for chat conversations

### Why It Matters

1. **No Forced Migrations**: Keep your existing document structure
2. **Gradual Adoption**: Start with V3 and migrate to V4 at your pace
3. **Custom Workflows**: Configure BMad to match your team's process
4. **Intelligent Agents**: Agents automatically adapt to your configuration

### Common Configurations

**Legacy V3 Project**:

```yaml
prdVersion: v3
prdSharded: false
architectureVersion: v3
architectureSharded: false
```

**V4 Optimized Project**:

```yaml
prdVersion: v4
prdSharded: true
prdShardedLocation: docs/prd
architectureVersion: v4
architectureSharded: true
architectureShardedLocation: docs/architecture
```

## Core Philosophy

### Vibe CEO'ing

You are the "Vibe CEO" - thinking like a CEO with unlimited resources and a singular vision. Your AI agents are your high-powered team, and your role is to:

- **Direct**: Provide clear instructions and objectives
- **Refine**: Iterate on outputs to achieve quality
- **Oversee**: Maintain strategic alignment across all agents

### Core Principles

1. **MAXIMIZE_AI_LEVERAGE**: Push the AI to deliver more. Challenge outputs and iterate.
2. **QUALITY_CONTROL**: You are the ultimate arbiter of quality. Review all outputs.
3. **STRATEGIC_OVERSIGHT**: Maintain the high-level vision and ensure alignment.
4. **ITERATIVE_REFINEMENT**: Expect to revisit steps. This is not a linear process.
5. **CLEAR_INSTRUCTIONS**: Precise requests lead to better outputs.
6. **DOCUMENTATION_IS_KEY**: Good inputs (briefs, PRDs) lead to good outputs.
7. **START_SMALL_SCALE_FAST**: Test concepts, then expand.
8. **EMBRACE_THE_CHAOS**: Adapt and overcome challenges.

### Key Workflow Principles

1. **Agent Specialization**: Each agent has specific expertise and responsibilities
2. **Clean Handoffs**: Always start fresh when switching between agents
3. **Status Tracking**: Maintain story statuses (Draft → Approved → InProgress → Done)
4. **Iterative Development**: Complete one story before starting the next
5. **Documentation First**: Always start with solid PRD and architecture

## Core Architecture

### System Overview

The BMAD-METHOD™ is built around a modular architecture centered on the `bmad-core` directory, which serves as the brain of the entire system. This design enables the framework to operate effectively in both IDE environments (like Cursor, VS Code) and web-based AI interfaces (like ChatGPT, Gemini).

### Key Architectural Components

#### 1. Agents (`bmad-core/agents/`)

- **Purpose**: Each markdown file defines a specialized AI agent for a specific Agile role (PM, Dev, Architect, etc.)
- **Structure**: Contains YAML headers specifying the agent's persona, capabilities, and dependencies
- **Dependencies**: Lists of tasks, templates, checklists, and data files the agent can use
- **Startup Instructions**: Can load project-specific documentation for immediate context

#### 2. Agent Teams (`bmad-core/agent-teams/`)

- **Purpose**: Define collections of agents bundled together for specific purposes
- **Examples**: `team-all.yaml` (comprehensive bundle), `team-fullstack.yaml` (full-stack development)
- **Usage**: Creates pre-packaged contexts for web UI environments

#### 3. Workflows (`bmad-core/workflows/`)

- **Purpose**: YAML files defining prescribed sequences of steps for specific project types
- **Types**: Greenfield (new projects) and Brownfield (existing projects) for UI, service, and fullstack development
- **Structure**: Defines agent interactions, artifacts created, and transition conditions

#### 4. Reusable Resources

- **Templates** (`bmad-core/templates/`): Markdown templates for PRDs, architecture specs, user stories
- **Tasks** (`bmad-core/tasks/`): Instructions for specific repeatable actions like "shard-doc" or "create-next-story"
- **Checklists** (`bmad-core/checklists/`): Quality assurance checklists for validation and review
- **Data** (`bmad-core/data/`): Core knowledge base and technical preferences

### Dual Environment Architecture

#### IDE Environment

- Users interact directly with agent markdown files
- Agents can access all dependencies dynamically
- Supports real-time file operations and project integration
- Optimized for development workflow execution

#### Web UI Environment

- Uses pre-built bundles from `dist/teams` for stand alone 1 upload files for all agents and their assets with an orchestrating agent
- Single text files containing all agent dependencies are in `dist/agents/` - these are unnecessary unless you want to create a web agent that is only a single agent and not a team
- Created by the web-builder tool for upload to web interfaces
- Provides complete context in one package

### Template Processing System

BMad employs a sophisticated template system with three key components:

1. **Template Format** (`utils/bmad-doc-template.md`): Defines markup language for variable substitution and AI processing directives from yaml templates
2. **Document Creation** (`tasks/create-doc.md`): Orchestrates template selection and user interaction to transform yaml spec to final markdown output
3. **Advanced Elicitation** (`tasks/advanced-elicitation.md`): Provides interactive refinement through structured brainstorming

### Technical Preferences Integration

The `technical-preferences.md` file serves as a persistent technical profile that:

- Ensures consistency across all agents and projects
- Eliminates repetitive technology specification
- Provides personalized recommendations aligned with user preferences
- Evolves over time with lessons learned

### Build and Delivery Process

The `web-builder.js` tool creates web-ready bundles by:

1. Reading agent or team definition files
2. Recursively resolving all dependencies
3. Concatenating content into single text files with clear separators
4. Outputting ready-to-upload bundles for web AI interfaces

This architecture enables seamless operation across environments while maintaining the rich, interconnected agent ecosystem that makes BMad powerful.

## Complete Development Workflow

### Planning Phase (Web UI Recommended - Especially Gemini!)

**Ideal for cost efficiency with Gemini's massive context:**

**For Brownfield Projects - Start Here!**:

1. **Upload entire project to Gemini Web** (GitHub URL, files, or zip)
2. **Document existing system**: `/analyst` → `*document-project`
3. **Creates comprehensive docs** from entire codebase analysis

**For All Projects**:

1. **Optional Analysis**: `/analyst` - Market research, competitive analysis
2. **Project Brief**: Create foundation document (Analyst or user)
3. **PRD Creation**: `/pm create-doc prd` - Comprehensive product requirements
4. **Architecture Design**: `/architect create-doc architecture` - Technical foundation
5. **Validation & Alignment**: `/po` run master checklist to ensure document consistency
6. **Document Preparation**: Copy final documents to project as `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md`

#### Example Planning Prompts

**For PRD Creation**:

```text
"I want to build a [type] application that [core purpose].
Help me brainstorm features and create a comprehensive PRD."
```

**For Architecture Design**:

```text
"Based on this PRD, design a scalable technical architecture
that can handle [specific requirements]."
```

### Critical Transition: Web UI to IDE

**Once planning is complete, you MUST switch to IDE for development:**

- **Why**: Development workflow requires file operations, real-time project integration, and document sharding
- **Cost Benefit**: Web UI is more cost-effective for large document creation; IDE is optimized for development tasks
- **Required Files**: Ensure `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md` exist in your project

### IDE Development Workflow

**Prerequisites**: Planning documents must exist in `docs/` folder

1. **Document Sharding** (CRITICAL STEP):
   - Documents created by PM/Architect (in Web or IDE) MUST be sharded for development
   - Two methods to shard:
     a) **Manual**: Drag `shard-doc` task + document file into chat
     b) **Agent**: Ask `@bmad-master` or `@po` to shard documents
   - Shards `docs/prd.md` → `docs/prd/` folder
   - Shards `docs/architecture.md` → `docs/architecture/` folder
   - **WARNING**: Do NOT shard in Web UI - copying many small files is painful!

2. **Verify Sharded Content**:
   - At least one `epic-n.md` file in `docs/prd/` with stories in development order
   - Source tree document and coding standards for dev agent reference
   - Sharded docs for SM agent story creation

Resulting Folder Structure:

- `docs/prd/` - Broken down PRD sections
- `docs/architecture/` - Broken down architecture sections
- `docs/stories/` - Generated user stories

1. **Development Cycle** (Sequential, one story at a time):

   **CRITICAL CONTEXT MANAGEMENT**:
   - **Context windows matter!** Always use fresh, clean context windows
   - **Model selection matters!** Use most powerful thinking model for SM story creation
   - **ALWAYS start new chat between SM, Dev, and QA work**

   **Step 1 - Story Creation**:
   - **NEW CLEAN CHAT** → Select powerful model → `@sm` → `*create`
   - SM executes create-next-story task
   - Review generated story in `docs/stories/`
   - Update status from "Draft" to "Approved"

   **Step 2 - Story Implementation**:
   - **NEW CLEAN CHAT** → `@dev`
   - Agent asks which story to implement
   - Include story file content to save dev agent lookup time
   - Dev follows tasks/subtasks, marking completion
   - Dev maintains File List of all changes
   - Dev marks story as "Review" when complete with all tests passing

   **Step 3 - Senior QA Review**:
   - **NEW CLEAN CHAT** → `@qa` → execute review-story task
   - QA performs senior developer code review
   - QA can refactor and improve code directly
   - QA appends results to story's QA Results section
   - If approved: Status → "Done"
   - If changes needed: Status stays "Review" with unchecked items for dev

   **Step 4 - Repeat**: Continue SM → Dev → QA cycle until all epic stories complete

**Important**: Only 1 story in progress at a time, worked sequentially until all epic stories complete.

### Status Tracking Workflow

Stories progress through defined statuses:

- **Draft** → **Approved** → **InProgress** → **Done**

Each status change requires user verification and approval before proceeding.

### Workflow Types

#### Greenfield Development

- Business analysis and market research
- Product requirements and feature definition
- System architecture and design
- Development execution
- Testing and deployment

#### Brownfield Enhancement (Existing Projects)

**Key Concept**: Brownfield development requires comprehensive documentation of your existing project for AI agents to understand context, patterns, and constraints.

**Complete Brownfield Workflow Options**:

**Option 1: PRD-First (Recommended for Large Codebases/Monorepos)**:

1. **Upload project to Gemini Web** (GitHub URL, files, or zip)
2. **Create PRD first**: `@pm` → `*create-doc brownfield-prd`
3. **Focused documentation**: `@analyst` → `*document-project`
   - Analyst asks for focus if no PRD provided
   - Choose "single document" format for Web UI
   - Uses PRD to document ONLY relevant areas
   - Creates one comprehensive markdown file
   - Avoids bloating docs with unused code

**Option 2: Document-First (Good for Smaller Projects)**:

1. **Upload project to Gemini Web**
2. **Document everything**: `@analyst` → `*document-project`
3. **Then create PRD**: `@pm` → `*create-doc brownfield-prd`
   - More thorough but can create excessive documentation

4. **Requirements Gathering**:
   - **Brownfield PRD**: Use PM agent with `brownfield-prd-tmpl`
   - **Analyzes**: Existing system, constraints, integration points
   - **Defines**: Enhancement scope, compatibility requirements, risk assessment
   - **Creates**: Epic and story structure for changes

5. **Architecture Planning**:
   - **Brownfield Architecture**: Use Architect agent with `brownfield-architecture-tmpl`
   - **Integration Strategy**: How new features integrate with existing system
   - **Migration Planning**: Gradual rollout and backwards compatibility
   - **Risk Mitigation**: Addressing potential breaking changes

**Brownfield-Specific Resources**:

**Templates**:

- `brownfield-prd-tmpl.md`: Comprehensive enhancement planning with existing system analysis
- `brownfield-architecture-tmpl.md`: Integration-focused architecture for existing systems

**Tasks**:

- `document-project`: Generates comprehensive documentation from existing codebase
- `brownfield-create-epic`: Creates single epic for focused enhancements (when full PRD is overkill)
- `brownfield-create-story`: Creates individual story for small, isolated changes

**When to Use Each Approach**:

**Full Brownfield Workflow** (Recommended for):

- Major feature additions
- System modernization
- Complex integrations
- Multiple related changes

**Quick Epic/Story Creation** (Use when):

- Single, focused enhancement
- Isolated bug fixes
- Small feature additions
- Well-documented existing system

**Critical Success Factors**:

1. **Documentation First**: Always run `document-project` if docs are outdated/missing
2. **Context Matters**: Provide agents access to relevant code sections
3. **Integration Focus**: Emphasize compatibility and non-breaking changes
4. **Incremental Approach**: Plan for gradual rollout and testing

**For detailed guide**: See `docs/working-in-the-brownfield.md`

## Document Creation Best Practices

### Required File Naming for Framework Integration

- `docs/prd.md` - Product Requirements Document
- `docs/architecture.md` - System Architecture Document

**Why These Names Matter**:

- Agents automatically reference these files during development
- Sharding tasks expect these specific filenames
- Workflow automation depends on standard naming

### Cost-Effective Document Creation Workflow

**Recommended for Large Documents (PRD, Architecture):**

1. **Use Web UI**: Create documents in web interface for cost efficiency
2. **Copy Final Output**: Save complete markdown to your project
3. **Standard Names**: Save as `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md`
4. **Switch to IDE**: Use IDE agents for development and smaller documents

### Document Sharding

Templates with Level 2 headings (`##`) can be automatically sharded:

**Original PRD**:

```markdown
## Goals and Background Context

## Requirements

## User Interface Design Goals

## Success Metrics
```

**After Sharding**:

- `docs/prd/goals-and-background-context.md`
- `docs/prd/requirements.md`
- `docs/prd/user-interface-design-goals.md`
- `docs/prd/success-metrics.md`

Use the `shard-doc` task or `@kayvan/markdown-tree-parser` tool for automatic sharding.

## Usage Patterns and Best Practices

### Environment-Specific Usage

**Web UI Best For**:

- Initial planning and documentation phases
- Cost-effective large document creation
- Agent consultation and brainstorming
- Multi-agent workflows with orchestrator

**IDE Best For**:
