  name: Brownfield Service/API Enhancement
  description: >-
    Agent workflow for enhancing existing backend services and APIs with new features,
    modernization, or performance improvements. Handles existing system analysis and safe integration.
  type: brownfield
  project_types:
    - service-modernization
    - api-enhancement
    - microservice-extraction
    - performance-optimization
    - integration-enhancement

  sequence:
    - step: service_analysis
      agent: architect
      action: analyze existing project and use task document-project
      creates: multiple documents per the document-project template
      notes: "Review existing service documentation, codebase, performance metrics, and identify integration dependencies."

    - agent: pm
      creates: prd.md
      uses: brownfield-prd-tmpl
      requires: existing_service_analysis
      notes: "Creates comprehensive PRD focused on service enhancement with existing system analysis. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final prd.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: architect
      creates: architecture.md
      uses: brownfield-architecture-tmpl
      requires: prd.md
      notes: "Creates architecture with service integration strategy and API evolution planning. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final architecture.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: po
      validates: all_artifacts
      uses: po-master-checklist
      notes: "Validates all documents for service integration safety and API compatibility. May require updates to any document."

    - agent: various
      updates: any_flagged_documents
      condition: po_checklist_issues
      notes: "If PO finds issues, return to relevant agent to fix and re-export updated documents to docs/ folder."

    - agent: po
      action: shard_documents
      creates: sharded_docs
      requires: all_artifacts_in_project
      notes: |
        Shard documents for IDE development:
        - Option A: Use PO agent to shard: @po then ask to shard docs/prd.md
        - Option B: Manual: Drag shard-doc task + docs/prd.md into chat
        - Creates docs/prd/ and docs/architecture/ folders with sharded content

    - agent: sm
      action: create_story
      creates: story.md
      requires: sharded_docs
      repeats: for_each_epic
      notes: |
        Story creation cycle:
        - SM Agent (New Chat): @sm → *create
        - Creates next story from sharded docs
        - Story starts in "Draft" status

    - agent: analyst/pm
      action: review_draft_story
      updates: story.md
      requires: story.md
      optional: true
      condition: user_wants_story_review
      notes: |
        OPTIONAL: Review and approve draft story
        - NOTE: story-review task coming soon
        - Review story completeness and alignment
        - Update story status: Draft → Approved

    - agent: dev
      action: implement_story
      creates: implementation_files
      requires: story.md
      notes: |
        Dev Agent (New Chat): @dev
        - Implements approved story
        - Updates File List with all changes
        - Marks story as "Review" when complete

    - agent: qa
      action: review_implementation
      updates: implementation_files
      requires: implementation_files
      optional: true
      notes: |
        OPTIONAL: QA Agent (New Chat): @qa → review-story
        - Senior dev review with refactoring ability
        - Fixes small issues directly
        - Leaves checklist for remaining items
        - Updates story status (Review → Done or stays Review)

    - agent: dev
      action: address_qa_feedback
      updates: implementation_files
      condition: qa_left_unchecked_items
      notes: |
        If QA left unchecked items:
        - Dev Agent (New Chat): Address remaining items
        - Return to QA for final approval

    - repeat_development_cycle:
      action: continue_for_all_stories
      notes: |
        Repeat story cycle (SM → Dev → QA) for all epic stories
        Continue until all stories in PRD are complete

    - agent: po
      action: epic_retrospective
      creates: epic-retrospective.md
      condition: epic_complete
      optional: true
      notes: |
        OPTIONAL: After epic completion
        - NOTE: epic-retrospective task coming soon
        - Validate epic was completed correctly
        - Document learnings and improvements

    - workflow_end:
      action: project_complete
      notes: |
        All stories implemented and reviewed!
        Project development phase complete.

  decision_guidance:
    when_to_use:
      - Service enhancement requires coordinated stories
      - API versioning or breaking changes needed
      - Database schema changes required
      - Performance or scalability improvements needed
      - Multiple integration points affected
