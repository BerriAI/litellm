    title: Goals and Background Context
    instruction: |
      Ask if Project Brief document is available. If NO Project Brief exists, STRONGLY recommend creating one first using project-brief-tmpl (it provides essential foundation: problem statement, target users, success metrics, MVP scope, constraints). If user insists on PRD without brief, gather this information during Goals section. If Project Brief exists, review and use it to populate Goals (bullet list of desired outcomes) and Background Context (1-2 paragraphs on what this solves and why) so we can determine what is and is not in scope for PRD mvp. Either way this is critical to determine the requirements. Include Change Log table.
    sections:
      - id: goals
        title: Goals
        type: bullet-list
        instruction: Bullet list of 1 line desired outcomes the PRD will deliver if successful - user and project desires
      - id: background
        title: Background Context
        type: paragraphs
        instruction: 1-2 short paragraphs summarizing the background context, such as what we learned in the brief without being redundant with the goals, what and why this solves a problem, what the current landscape or need is

        title: Functional
        type: numbered-list
        prefix: FR
        instruction: Each Requirement will be a bullet markdown and an identifier sequence starting with FR
        examples:
          - "FR6: The Todo List uses AI to detect and warn against potentially duplicate todo items that are worded differently."
      - id: non-functional
        title: Non Functional
        type: numbered-list
        prefix: NFR
        instruction: Each Requirement will be a bullet markdown and an identifier sequence starting with NFR
        examples:
          - "NFR1: AWS service usage must aim to stay within free-tier limits where feasible."

  - id: ui-goals
    title: User Interface Design Goals
    condition: PRD has UX/UI requirements
    instruction: |
      Capture high-level UI/UX vision to guide Design Architect and to inform story creation. Steps:

      1. Pre-fill all subsections with educated guesses based on project context
      2. Present the complete rendered section to user
      3. Clearly let the user know where assumptions were made
      4. Ask targeted questions for unclear/missing elements or areas needing more specification
      5. This is NOT detailed UI spec - focus on product vision and user goals
    elicit: true
    choices:
      accessibility: [None, WCAG AA, WCAG AAA]
      platforms: [Web Responsive, Mobile Only, Desktop Only, Cross-Platform]

  - id: technical-assumptions
    title: Technical Assumptions
    instruction: |
      Gather technical decisions that will guide the Architect. Steps:

      1. Check if .bmad-core/data/technical-preferences.yaml or an attached technical-preferences file exists - use it to pre-populate choices
      2. Ask user about: languages, frameworks, starter templates, libraries, APIs, deployment targets
      3. For unknowns, offer guidance based on project goals and MVP scope
      4. Document ALL technical choices with rationale (why this choice fits the project)
      5. These become constraints for the Architect - be specific and complete
    elicit: true
    choices:
      repository: [Monorepo, Polyrepo]
      architecture: [Monolith, Microservices, Serverless]
      testing: [Unit Only, Unit + Integration, Full Testing Pyramid]

        instruction: Throughout the entire process of drafting this document, if any other technical assumptions are raised or discovered appropriate for the architect, add them here as additional bulleted items

  - id: epic-list
    title: Epic List
    instruction: |
      Present a high-level list of all epics for user approval. Each epic should have a title and a short (1 sentence) goal statement. This allows the user to review the overall structure before diving into details.

      CRITICAL: Epics MUST be logically sequential following agile best practices:

      - Each epic should deliver a significant, end-to-end, fully deployable increment of testable functionality
      - Epic 1 must establish foundational project infrastructure (app setup, Git, CI/CD, core services) unless we are adding new functionality to an existing app, while also delivering an initial piece of functionality, even as simple as a health-check route or display of a simple canary page - remember this when we produce the stories for the first epic!
      - Each subsequent epic builds upon previous epics' functionality delivering major blocks of functionality that provide tangible value to users or business when deployed
      - Not every project needs multiple epics, an epic needs to deliver value. For example, an API completed can deliver value even if a UI is not complete and planned for a separate epic.
      - Err on the side of less epics, but let the user know your rationale and offer options for splitting them if it seems some are too large or focused on disparate things.
      - Cross Cutting Concerns should flow through epics and stories and not be final stories. For example, adding a logging framework as a last story of an epic, or at the end of a project as a final epic or story would be terrible as we would not have logging from the beginning.
    elicit: true
    examples:
      - "Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure: Establish project setup, authentication, and basic user management"
      - "Epic 2: Core Business Entities: Create and manage primary domain objects with CRUD operations"
      - "Epic 3: User Workflows & Interactions: Enable key user journeys and business processes"
      - "Epic 4: Reporting & Analytics: Provide insights and data visualization for users"

  - id: epic-details
    title: Epic {{epic_number}} {{epic_title}}
    repeatable: true
    instruction: |
      After the epic list is approved, present each epic with all its stories and acceptance criteria as a complete review unit.

      For each epic provide expanded goal (2-3 sentences describing the objective and value all the stories will achieve).

      CRITICAL STORY SEQUENCING REQUIREMENTS:

      - Stories within each epic MUST be logically sequential
      - Each story should be a "vertical slice" delivering complete functionality aside from early enabler stories for project foundation
      - No story should depend on work from a later story or epic
      - Identify and note any direct prerequisite stories
      - Focus on "what" and "why" not "how" (leave technical implementation to Architect) yet be precise enough to support a logical sequential order of operations from story to story.
      - Ensure each story delivers clear user or business value, try to avoid enablers and build them into stories that deliver value.
      - Size stories for AI agent execution: Each story must be completable by a single AI agent in one focused session without context overflow
      - Think "junior developer working for 2-4 hours" - stories must be small, focused, and self-contained
      - If a story seems complex, break it down further as long as it can deliver a vertical slice

            repeatable: true
            instruction: |
              Define clear, comprehensive, and testable acceptance criteria that:

              - Precisely define what "done" means from a functional perspective
              - Are unambiguous and serve as basis for verification
              - Include any critical non-functional requirements from the PRD
              - Consider local testability for backend/data components
              - Specify UI/UX requirements and framework adherence where applicable
              - Avoid cross-cutting concerns that should be in other stories or PRD sections
