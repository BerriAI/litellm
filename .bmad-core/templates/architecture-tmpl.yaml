    title: Introduction
    instruction: |
      If available, review any provided relevant documents to gather all relevant context before beginning. If at a minimum you cannot locate docs/prd.md ask the user what docs will provide the basis for the architecture.
    sections:
      - id: intro-content
        content: |
          This document outlines the overall project architecture for {{project_name}}, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

          **Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
          If the project includes a significant user interface, a separate Frontend Architecture Document will detail the frontend-specific design and MUST be used in conjunction with this document. Core technology stack choices documented herein (see "Tech Stack") are definitive for the entire project, including any frontend components.
      - id: starter-template
        title: Starter Template or Existing Project
        instruction: |
          Before proceeding further with architecture design, check if the project is based on a starter template or existing codebase:

          1. Review the PRD and brainstorming brief for any mentions of:
          - Starter templates (e.g., Create React App, Next.js, Vue CLI, Angular CLI, etc.)
          - Existing projects or codebases being used as a foundation
          - Boilerplate projects or scaffolding tools
          - Previous projects to be cloned or adapted

          2. If a starter template or existing project is mentioned:
          - Ask the user to provide access via one of these methods:
            - Link to the starter template documentation
            - Upload/attach the project files (for small projects)
            - Share a link to the project repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
          - Analyze the starter/existing project to understand:
            - Pre-configured technology stack and versions
            - Project structure and organization patterns
            - Built-in scripts and tooling
            - Existing architectural patterns and conventions
            - Any limitations or constraints imposed by the starter
          - Use this analysis to inform and align your architecture decisions

          3. If no starter template is mentioned but this is a greenfield project:
          - Suggest appropriate starter templates based on the tech stack preferences
          - Explain the benefits (faster setup, best practices, community support)
          - Let the user decide whether to use one

          4. If the user confirms no starter template will be used:
          - Proceed with architecture design from scratch
          - Note that manual setup will be required for all tooling and configuration

          Document the decision here before proceeding with the architecture design. If none, just say N/A

    sections:
      - id: technical-summary
        title: Technical Summary
        instruction: |
          Provide a brief paragraph (3-5 sentences) overview of:
          - The system's overall architecture style
          - Key components and their relationships
          - Primary technology choices
          - Core architectural patterns being used
          - Reference back to the PRD goals and how this architecture supports them
      - id: high-level-overview
        title: High Level Overview
        instruction: |
          Based on the PRD's Technical Assumptions section, describe:

          1. The main architectural style (e.g., Monolith, Microservices, Serverless, Event-Driven)
          2. Repository structure decision from PRD (Monorepo/Polyrepo)
          3. Service architecture decision from PRD
          4. Primary user interaction flow or data flow at a conceptual level
          5. Key architectural decisions and their rationale
      - id: project-diagram
        title: High Level Project Diagram
        type: mermaid
        mermaid_type: graph
        instruction: |
          Create a Mermaid diagram that visualizes the high-level architecture. Consider:
          - System boundaries
          - Major components/services
          - Data flow directions
          - External integrations
          - User entry points

      - id: architectural-patterns
        title: Architectural and Design Patterns
        instruction: |
          List the key high-level patterns that will guide the architecture. For each pattern:

          1. Present 2-3 viable options if multiple exist
          2. Provide your recommendation with clear rationale
          3. Get user confirmation before finalizing
          4. These patterns should align with the PRD's technical assumptions and project goals

          Common patterns to consider:
          - Architectural style patterns (Serverless, Event-Driven, Microservices, CQRS, Hexagonal)
          - Code organization patterns (Dependency Injection, Repository, Module, Factory)
          - Data patterns (Event Sourcing, Saga, Database per Service)
          - Communication patterns (REST, GraphQL, Message Queue, Pub/Sub)
        template: "- **{{pattern_name}}:** {{pattern_description}} - _Rationale:_ {{rationale}}"
        examples:
          - "**Serverless Architecture:** Using AWS Lambda for compute - _Rationale:_ Aligns with PRD requirement for cost optimization and automatic scaling"
          - "**Repository Pattern:** Abstract data access logic - _Rationale:_ Enables testing and future database migration flexibility"
          - "**Event-Driven Communication:** Using SNS/SQS for service decoupling - _Rationale:_ Supports async processing and system resilience"

  - id: tech-stack
    title: Tech Stack
    instruction: |
      This is the DEFINITIVE technology selection section. Work with the user to make specific choices:

      1. Review PRD technical assumptions and any preferences from .bmad-core/data/technical-preferences.yaml or an attached technical-preferences
      2. For each category, present 2-3 viable options with pros/cons
      3. Make a clear recommendation based on project needs
      4. Get explicit user approval for each selection
      5. Document exact versions (avoid "latest" - pin specific versions)
      6. This table is the single source of truth - all other docs must reference these choices

      Key decisions to finalize - before displaying the table, ensure you are aware of or ask the user about - let the user know if they are not sure on any that you can also provide suggestions with rationale:

      - Starter templates (if any)
      - Languages and runtimes with exact versions
      - Frameworks and libraries / packages
      - Cloud provider and key services choices
      - Database and storage solutions - if unclear suggest sql or nosql or other types depending on the project and depending on cloud provider offer a suggestion
      - Development tools

      Upon render of the table, ensure the user is aware of the importance of this sections choices, should also look for gaps or disagreements with anything, ask for any clarifications if something is unclear why its in the list, and also right away elicit feedback - this statement and the options should be rendered and then prompt right all before allowing user input.

    instruction: |
      Define MANDATORY security requirements for AI and human developers:

      1. Focus on implementation-specific rules
      2. Reference security tools from Tech Stack
      3. Define clear patterns for common scenarios
      4. These rules directly impact code generation
      5. Work with user to ensure completeness without redundancy

      After completing the architecture:

      1. If project has UI components:
      - Use "Frontend Architecture Mode"
      - Provide this document as input

      2. For all projects:
      - Review with Product Owner
      - Begin story implementation with Dev agent
      - Set up infrastructure with DevOps agent

      3. Include specific prompts for next agents if needed

          - Reference to this architecture document
          - Key UI requirements from PRD
          - Any frontend-specific decisions made here
          - Request for detailed frontend architecture
