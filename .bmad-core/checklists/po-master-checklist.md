# Product Owner (PO) Master Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for the Product Owner to validate project plans before development execution. It adapts intelligently based on project type (greenfield vs brownfield) and includes UI/UX considerations when applicable.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PO MASTER CHECKLIST

PROJECT TYPE DETECTION:
First, determine the project type by checking:

1. Is this a GREENFIELD project (new from scratch)?
   - Look for: New project initialization, no existing codebase references
   - Check for: prd.md, architecture.md, new project setup stories

2. Is this a BROWNFIELD project (enhancing existing system)?
   - Look for: References to existing codebase, enhancement/modification language
   - Check for: brownfield-prd.md, brownfield-architecture.md, existing system analysis

3. Does the project include UI/UX components?
   - Check for: frontend-architecture.md, UI/UX specifications, design files
   - Look for: Frontend stories, component specifications, user interface mentions

DOCUMENT REQUIREMENTS:
Based on project type, ensure you have access to:

For GREENFIELD projects:

- prd.md - The Product Requirements Document
- architecture.md - The system architecture
- frontend-architecture.md - If UI/UX is involved
- All epic and story definitions

For BROWNFIELD projects:

- brownfield-prd.md - The brownfield enhancement requirements
- brownfield-architecture.md - The enhancement architecture
- Existing project codebase access (CRITICAL - cannot proceed without this)
- Current deployment configuration and infrastructure details
- Database schemas, API documentation, monitoring setup

SKIP INSTRUCTIONS:

- Skip sections marked [[BROWNFIELD ONLY]] for greenfield projects
- Skip sections marked [[GREENFIELD ONLY]] for brownfield projects
- Skip sections marked [[UI/UX ONLY]] for backend-only projects
- Note all skipped sections in your final report

VALIDATION APPROACH:

1. Deep Analysis - Thoroughly analyze each item against documentation
2. Evidence-Based - Cite specific sections or code when validating
3. Critical Thinking - Question assumptions and identify gaps
4. Risk Assessment - Consider what could go wrong with each decision

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:

- Section by section (interactive mode) - Review each section, get confirmation before proceeding
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full analysis and present report at end]]
