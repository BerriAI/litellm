# Architect Solution Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for the Architect to validate the technical design and architecture before development execution. The Architect should systematically work through each item, ensuring the architecture is robust, scalable, secure, and aligned with the product requirements.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - REQUIRED ARTIFACTS

Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. architecture.md - The primary architecture document (check docs/architecture.md)
2. prd.md - Product Requirements Document for requirements alignment (check docs/prd.md)
3. frontend-architecture.md or fe-architecture.md - If this is a UI project (check docs/frontend-architecture.md)
4. Any system diagrams referenced in the architecture
5. API documentation if available
6. Technology stack details and version specifications

IMPORTANT: If any required documents are missing or inaccessible, immediately ask the user for their location or content before proceeding.

PROJECT TYPE DETECTION:
First, determine the project type by checking:

- Does the architecture include a frontend/UI component?
- Is there a frontend-architecture.md document?
- Does the PRD mention user interfaces or frontend requirements?

If this is a backend-only or service-only project:

- Skip sections marked with [[FRONTEND ONLY]]
- Focus extra attention on API design, service architecture, and integration patterns
- Note in your final report that frontend sections were skipped due to project type

VALIDATION APPROACH:
For each section, you must:

1. Deep Analysis - Don't just check boxes, thoroughly analyze each item against the provided documentation
2. Evidence-Based - Cite specific sections or quotes from the documents when validating
3. Critical Thinking - Question assumptions and identify gaps, not just confirm what's present
4. Risk Assessment - Consider what could go wrong with each architectural decision

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:

- Section by section (interactive mode) - Review each section, present findings, get confirmation before proceeding
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full analysis and present comprehensive report at end]]

## 1. REQUIREMENTS ALIGNMENT

[[LLM: Before evaluating this section, take a moment to fully understand the product's purpose and goals from the PRD. What is the core problem being solved? Who are the users? What are the critical success factors? Keep these in mind as you validate alignment.
