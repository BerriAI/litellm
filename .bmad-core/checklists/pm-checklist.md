# Product Manager (PM) Requirements Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework to ensure the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and Epic definitions are complete, well-structured, and appropriately scoped for MVP development. The PM should systematically work through each item during the product definition process.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PM CHECKLIST

Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. prd.md - The Product Requirements Document (check docs/prd.md)
2. Any user research, market analysis, or competitive analysis documents
3. Business goals and strategy documents
4. Any existing epic definitions or user stories

IMPORTANT: If the PRD is missing, immediately ask the user for its location or content before proceeding.

VALIDATION APPROACH:

1. User-Centric - Every requirement should tie back to user value
2. MVP Focus - Ensure scope is truly minimal while viable
3. Clarity - Requirements should be unambiguous and testable
4. Completeness - All aspects of the product vision are covered
5. Feasibility - Requirements are technically achievable

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:

- Section by section (interactive mode) - Review each section, present findings, get confirmation before proceeding
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full analysis and present comprehensive report at end]]

## 1. PROBLEM DEFINITION & CONTEXT

[[LLM: The foundation of any product is a clear problem statement. As you review this section:

1. Verify the problem is real and worth solving
2. Check that the target audience is specific, not "everyone"
3. Ensure success metrics are measurable, not vague aspirations
4. Look for evidence of user research, not just assumptions
5. Confirm the problem-solution fit is logical]]

### 1.1 Problem Statement

- [ ] Clear articulation of the problem being solved
- [ ] Identification of who experiences the problem

## 2. MVP SCOPE DEFINITION

[[LLM: MVP scope is critical - too much and you waste resources, too little and you can't validate. Check:

1. Is this truly minimal? Challenge every feature
2. Does each feature directly address the core problem?
3. Are "nice-to-haves" clearly separated from "must-haves"?
4. Is the rationale for inclusion/exclusion documented?
5. Can you ship this in the target timeframe?]]
