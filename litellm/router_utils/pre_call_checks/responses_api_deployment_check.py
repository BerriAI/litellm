"""
For Responses API, we need routing affinity when a user sends a previous_response_id.

eg. If proxy admins are load balancing between N gpt-4.1-turbo deployments, and a user sends a previous_response_id,
we want to route to the same gpt-4.1-turbo deployment.

This is different from the normal behavior of the router, which does not have routing affinity for previous_response_id.


If previous_response_id is provided, route to the deployment that returned the previous response
