# Auto-Router Configuration
# Controls how messages are classified and routed to model tiers.
#
# Usage: Set `auto_router_config_path` in your deployment's litellm_params
# to the path of this file.

# Model tiers: map each cost tier to a specific model
tiers:
  low:
    model: "google/gemini-2.5-flash"
    max_cost_per_m_tokens: 1.0
  mid:
    model: "google/gemini-2.5-flash"
    max_cost_per_m_tokens: 5.0
  top:
    model: "chatgpt/gpt-5.2-codex"
    max_cost_per_m_tokens: 30.0

# Category -> tier routing: which tier handles each task category
# Categories: heartbeat, simple-chat, lookup, translation,
#             summarization, coding, creative, reasoning, analysis
routing:
  heartbeat: low
  simple-chat: low
  lookup: low
  translation: mid
  summarization: mid
  coding: mid
  creative: mid
  reasoning: top
  analysis: top

# Custom regex patterns (evaluated before built-in patterns, first match wins)
# Each entry needs a `pattern` (regex) and `category` (one of the categories above)
custom_patterns: []
  # Examples:
  # - pattern: "kubernetes|k8s|helm|docker-compose"
  #   category: "coding"
  # - pattern: "security\\s+audit|penetration\\s+test"
  #   category: "analysis"
