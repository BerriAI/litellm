"""Injected dependencies: the package's only window onto ambient litellm state.

The translation core is pure; anything that would otherwise read the model
map or a ``litellm`` module global enters here as a value, built once at the
dispatch seam (outside this package) and threaded through ``engine.pipeline``.
That keeps providers unit-testable with hand-built deps and keeps the package
free of upward imports.

    - ``max_tokens_for_model``: model-map max output tokens, ``None`` when the
      model has no entry (v1: ``get_max_tokens``).
    - ``supports_capability``: boolean capability check against the model map
      with provider-prefix stripping, ``False`` when undeclared (v1:
      ``AnthropicModelInfo._supports_model_capability``).
    - ``capability_flag``: raw tri-state capability flag, ``None`` when the
      model map does not declare it so name-based fallbacks apply (v1:
      ``AnthropicModelInfo._get_model_capability``).
    - ``drop_params``: the effective flag (``litellm.drop_params`` OR the
      request-level kwarg), what v1's ``_apply_sampling_param`` honors.
    - ``drop_params_global``: only ``litellm.drop_params``; v1's stop-sequence
      filter and ``output_config`` drop read the global alone.
    - ``modify_params``: the litellm global, read once at the seam. The seam
      only routes to v2 when it is False; carried so serializers can assert
      the contract.
    - ``api_version``: the resolved azure api-version string (v1:
      ``get_optional_params``' azure branch resolves request kwarg ->
      ``litellm.api_version`` -> env -> ``AZURE_DEFAULT_API_VERSION`` before
      passing it into ``map_openai_params``, utils.py:4865-4875). In v1 the
      version reaching ``map_openai_params`` is ALWAYS a string, so ``None``
      here means the seam never wired the field: the azure gates return a
      typed fallback on it, NOT v1's unparseable-STRING passthrough (which
      needs a real string like ``""``). The default exists for the
      providers that never read the field.
    - ``base_model``: the azure deployment's declared base model; v1 detects
      o-series/gpt-5 param families on ``base_model or model``
      (azure.py:245-247). ``None`` for providers without deployment aliasing.
    - ``api_base``: the request-level api_base (v1: ``litellm_params
      ["api_base"]``), wave-2b-alpha for huggingface — its transform forks
      on EXACTLY this value (hf chat/transformation.py:135: the verbatim
      dedicated-endpoint body vs the router route whose 3-segment names
      fetch the HF provider mapping over HTTP inside the transform). v2
      serves ONLY the api_base route; ``None`` means the seam never wired
      the field and every huggingface request falls back typed. ``None``
      for providers that never read it.
