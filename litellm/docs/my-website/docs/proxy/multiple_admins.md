As a Proxy Admin, you can check if and when a entity (key, team, user, model) was created, updated, deleted, or regenerated, along with who performed the action. This is useful for auditing and compliance.

LiteLLM tracks changes to the following entities and actions:

- **Entities:** Keys, Teams, Users, Models
- **Actions:** Create, Update, Delete, Regenerate

## Usage

### 1. Switch on audit Logs 
Add `store_audit_logs` to your litellm config.yaml and then start the proxy
```shell
litellm_settings:
  store_audit_logs: true
```

### 2. Make a change to an entity

In this example, we will delete a key.

```shell
curl -X POST 'http://0.0.0.0:4000/key/delete' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer sk-1234' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "key": "d5265fc73296c8fea819b4525590c99beab8c707e465afdf60dab57e1fa145e4"
    }'
```

### 3. View the audit log on LiteLLM UI

On the LiteLLM UI, navigate to Logs -> Audit Logs. You should see the audit log for the key deletion.

## Advanced

### Attribute Management changes to Users

Call management endpoints on behalf of a user. (Useful when connecting proxy to your development platform).

## 1. Set `LiteLLM-Changed-By` in request headers

Set the 'user_id' in request headers, when calling a management endpoint. [View Full List](https://litellm-api.up.railway.app/#/team%20management).

- Update Team budget with master key. 
- Attribute change to 'krrish@berri.ai'. 

**ðŸ‘‰ Key change:** Passing `-H 'LiteLLM-Changed-By: krrish@berri.ai'`

```shell
curl -X POST 'http://0.0.0.0:4000/team/update' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer sk-1234' \
    -H 'LiteLLM-Changed-By: krrish@berri.ai' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "team_id" : "8bf18b11-7f52-4717-8e1f-7c65f9d01e52",
        "max_budget": 2000
    }'
```

## 2. Emitted Audit Log 

```bash
{
   "id": "bd136c28-edd0-4cb6-b963-f35464cf6f5a",
   "updated_at": "2024-06-08 23:41:14.793",
