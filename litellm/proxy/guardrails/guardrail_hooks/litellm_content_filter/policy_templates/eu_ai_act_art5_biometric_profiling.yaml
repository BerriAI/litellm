# EU AI Act Article 5.1(d)(g)(h) — Biometric Categorization & Predictive Profiling
# Prohibits:
# - Real-time remote biometric identification in public spaces (5.1.d)
# - Untargeted scraping of facial images for facial recognition databases (5.1.g)
# - Biometric categorization to infer race, political opinions, religion,
#   sexual orientation (5.1.h)
# - Predictive policing based solely on profiling (5.1.d related)
