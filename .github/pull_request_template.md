- [ ] I have Added testing in the [`tests/litellm/`](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/tree/main/tests/litellm) directory, **Adding at least 1 test is a hard requirement** - [see details](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/extras/contributing_code)
- [ ] My PR passes all unit tests on [`make test-unit`](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/extras/contributing_code)
- [ ] My PR's scope is as isolated as possible, it only solves 1 specific problem

## CI (LiteLLM team)

> **CI status guideline:**
>
> - 50-55 passing tests: main is stable with minor issues.
> - 45-49 passing tests: acceptable but needs attention
> - <= 40 passing tests: unstable; be careful with your merges and assess the risk.
