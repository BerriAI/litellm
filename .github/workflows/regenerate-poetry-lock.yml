Automated regeneration of \`poetry.lock\` after \`pyproject.toml\` was updated on \`main\`.

Fixes the recurring CI failure:
\`\`\`
pyproject.toml changed significantly since poetry.lock was last generated.
Run \`poetry lock\` to fix the lock file.
\`\`\`

Regenerated with \`poetry lock --no-update\` (existing package versions are preserved; only the lock file metadata is updated to match the new constraints).
