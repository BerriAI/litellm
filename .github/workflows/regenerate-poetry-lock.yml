          Automated regeneration of `poetry.lock` after `pyproject.toml` was updated on `main`.

          Fixes the recurring CI failure:
          ```
          pyproject.toml changed significantly since poetry.lock was last generated.
          Run `poetry lock` to fix the lock file.
          ```

          Regenerated with `poetry lock --no-update` (existing package versions are preserved; only the lock file metadata is updated to match the new constraints).
