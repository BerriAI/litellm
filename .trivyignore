# MEDIUM: Image Optimizer DoS
CVE-2025-59471

# Docusaurus docs build tool vulnerabilities (docs/my-website/package-lock.json)
# These are dev-only dependencies used to build the docs site, not runtime dependencies.
# The minimatch fix requires a 3.x→10.x major version jump (breaking API change) that
# would break webpack internals. The ajv fix similarly requires cross-major overrides
# that risk breaking the docs build. No production exposure.

# MEDIUM: ajv ReDoS via $data reference
CVE-2025-69873

# HIGH: minimatch DoS via crafted glob patterns (fix requires breaking 3.x→10.x upgrade)
CVE-2026-26996
