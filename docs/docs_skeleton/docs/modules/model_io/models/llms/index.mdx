# LLMs

:::info
Head to [Integrations](/docs/integrations/llms/) for documentation on built-in integrations with LLM providers.
:::

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a core component of LangChain.
LangChain does not serve its own LLMs, but rather provides a standard interface for interacting with many different LLMs.

## Get started

There are lots of LLM providers (OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, etc) - the `LLM` class is designed to provide a standard interface for all of them.

In this walkthrough we'll work with an OpenAI LLM wrapper, although the functionalities highlighted are generic for all LLM types.

import LLMGetStarted from "@snippets/modules/model_io/models/llms/get_started.mdx"
