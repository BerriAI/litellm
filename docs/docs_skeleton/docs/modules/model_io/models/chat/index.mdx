# Chat models

:::info
Head to [Integrations](/docs/integrations/chat/) for documentation on built-in integrations with chat model providers.

Chat models are a variation on language models.
While chat models use language models under the hood, the interface they expose is a bit different.
Rather than expose a "text in, text out" API, they expose an interface where "chat messages" are the inputs and outputs.

Chat model APIs are fairly new, so we are still figuring out the correct abstractions.
