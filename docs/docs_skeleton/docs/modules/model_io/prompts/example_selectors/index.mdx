# Example selectors

If you have a large number of examples, you may need to select which ones to include in the prompt. The Example Selector is the class responsible for doing so.

The base interface is defined as below:

import GetStarted from "@snippets/modules/model_io/prompts/example_selectors/get_started.mdx"

<GetStarted/>
