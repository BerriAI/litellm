# Partial prompt templates

Like other methods, it can make sense to "partial" a prompt template - eg pass in a subset of the required values, as to create a new prompt template which expects only the remaining subset of values.

LangChain supports this in two ways:
1. Partial formatting with string values.
2. Partial formatting with functions that return string values.

These two different ways support different use cases. In the examples below, we go over the motivations for both use cases as well as how to do it in LangChain.
