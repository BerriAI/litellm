# Document loaders

:::info
Head to [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/) for documentation on built-in document loader integrations with 3rd-party tools.
:::

Use document loaders to load data from a source as `Document`'s. A `Document` is a piece of text
and associated metadata. For example, there are document loaders for loading a simple `.txt` file, for loading the text
contents of any web page, or even for loading a transcript of a YouTube video.

Document loaders expose a "load" method for loading data as documents from a configured source. They optionally
implement a "lazy load" as well for lazily loading data into memory.
