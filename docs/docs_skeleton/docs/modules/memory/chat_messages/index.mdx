# Chat Messages

:::info
Head to [Integrations](/docs/integrations/memory/) for documentation on built-in memory integrations with 3rd-party databases and tools.

One of the core utility classes underpinning most (if not all) memory modules is the `ChatMessageHistory` class.
This is a super lightweight wrapper which exposes convenience methods for saving Human messages, AI messages, and then fetching them all.

You may want to use this class directly if you are managing memory outside of a chain.
