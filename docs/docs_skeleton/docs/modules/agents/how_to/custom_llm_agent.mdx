# Custom LLM Agent

This notebook goes through how to create your own custom LLM agent.

An LLM agent consists of three parts:

- PromptTemplate: This is the prompt template that can be used to instruct the language model on what to do
- LLM: This is the language model that powers the agent
- `stop` sequence: Instructs the LLM to stop generating as soon as this string is found
- OutputParser: This determines how to parse the LLMOutput into an AgentAction or AgentFinish object
