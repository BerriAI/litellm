Tools are interfaces that an agent can use to interact with the world.

## Get started

Tools are functions that agents can use to interact with the world.

Currently, tools can be loaded with the following snippet:

import GetStarted from "@snippets/modules/agents/tools/get_started.mdx"

<GetStarted/>
