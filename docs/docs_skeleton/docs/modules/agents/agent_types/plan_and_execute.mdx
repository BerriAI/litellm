# Plan and execute

Plan and execute agents accomplish an objective by first planning what to do, then executing the sub tasks. This idea is largely inspired by [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) and then the ["Plan-and-Solve" paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04091).

The planning is almost always done by an LLM.

The execution is usually done by a separate agent (equipped with tools).
