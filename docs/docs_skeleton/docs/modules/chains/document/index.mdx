# Documents

These are the core chains for working with Documents. They are useful for summarizing documents, answering questions over documents, extracting information from documents, and more.

These chains all implement a common interface:

import Interface from "@snippets/modules/chains/document/combine_docs.mdx"

<Interface/>

import DocCardList from "@theme/DocCardList";

<DocCardList />
