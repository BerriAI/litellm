# Stuff

The stuff documents chain ("stuff" as in "to stuff" or "to fill") is the most straightforward of the document chains. It takes a list of documents, inserts them all into a prompt and passes that prompt to an LLM.

This chain is well-suited for applications where documents are small and only a few are passed in for most calls.
