# Introduction

**LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that are:
- **Data-aware**: connect a language model to other sources of data
- **Agentic**: allow a language model to interact with its environment

The main value props of LangChain are:
1. **Components**: abstractions for working with language models, along with a collection of implementations for each abstraction. Components are modular and easy-to-use, whether you are using the rest of the LangChain framework or not
2. **Off-the-shelf chains**: a structured assembly of components for accomplishing specific higher-level tasks

Off-the-shelf chains make it easy to get started. For more complex applications and nuanced use-cases, components make it easy to customize existing chains or build new ones.

## Get started

[Here’s](/docs/get_started/installation.html) how to install LangChain, set up your environment, and start building.

We recommend following our [Quickstart](/docs/get_started/quickstart.html) guide to familiarize yourself with the framework by building your first LangChain application.

_**Note**: These docs are for the LangChain [Python package](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain). For documentation on [LangChain.js](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchainjs), the JS/TS version, [head here](https://js.langchain.com/docs)._

## Modules

LangChain provides standard, extendable interfaces and external integrations for the following modules, listed from least to most complex:

#### [Model I/O](/docs/modules/model_io/)
Interface with language models
#### [Data connection](/docs/modules/data_connection/)
Interface with application-specific data
#### [Chains](/docs/modules/chains/)
Construct sequences of calls
#### [Agents](/docs/modules/agents/)
Let chains choose which tools to use given high-level directives
#### [Memory](/docs/modules/memory/)
Persist application state between runs of a chain
#### [Callbacks](/docs/modules/callbacks/)
Log and stream intermediate steps of any chain
