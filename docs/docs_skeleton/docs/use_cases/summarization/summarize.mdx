# Summarization

A summarization chain can be used to summarize multiple documents. One way is to input multiple smaller documents, after they have been divided into chunks, and operate over them with a MapReduceDocumentsChain. You can also choose instead for the chain that does summarization to be a StuffDocumentsChain, or a RefineDocumentsChain.
