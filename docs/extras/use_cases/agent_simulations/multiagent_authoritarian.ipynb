    "1. steering the conversation by choosing which agent speaks when\n",
    "2. terminating the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to implement such an agent, we need to solve several problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, to steer the conversation, the `DirectorDialogueAgent` needs to (1) reflect on what has been said, (2) choose the next agent, and (3) prompt the next agent to speak, all in a single message. While it may be possible to prompt an LLM to perform all three steps in the same call, this requires writing custom code to parse the outputted message to extract which next agent is chosen to speak. This is less reliable the LLM can express how it chooses the next agent in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we can do instead is to explicitly break steps (1-3) into three separate LLM calls. First we will ask the `DirectorDialogueAgent` to reflect on the conversation so far and generate a response. Then we prompt the `DirectorDialogueAgent` to output the index of the next agent, which is easily parseable. Lastly, we pass the name of the selected next agent back to `DirectorDialogueAgent` to ask it prompt the next agent to speak. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, simply prompting the `DirectorDialogueAgent` to decide when to terminate the conversation often results in the `DirectorDialogueAgent` terminating the conversation immediately. To fix this problem, we randomly sample a Bernoulli variable to decide whether the conversation should terminate. Depending on the value of this variable, we will inject a custom prompt to tell the `DirectorDialogueAgent` to either continue the conversation or terminate the conversation."

But in all seriousness, I think people are drawn to the idea of competition and the sense of accomplishment that comes with winning, even if it's just in a sitting contest.

And while competitive sitting may seem harmless, there could be some unforeseen consequences. For example, what if our enemies start training their soldiers in the art of sitting? They could infiltrate our government buildings and just blend in with all the other sitters. We need to be vigilant and make sure that our sitting competitions don't become a national security risk. *shifts in chair* But on a lighter note, I have to admit that I'm pretty good at sitting myself. Maybe I should start training for the next competition.\n",

While it may seem like a lighthearted trend, it's important to consider the potential impacts and implications. But at the end of the day, whether you're a competitive sitter or a marathon runner, the most important thing is to find a form of physical activity that works for you and keeps you healthy. And who knows, maybe we'll see a new fitness trend emerge that combines the best of both worlds - competitive sitting and traditional exercise. *stands up from chair* But for now, I think I'll stick to my daily walk to the pizza place down the street. Ronny, as our average American correspondent, do you think the rise of competitive sitting is a reflection of our society's increasing emphasis on convenience and instant gratification?\n",

      "\n",
      "(Ronny Chieng): Absolutely, Jon. We live in a world where everything is at our fingertips, and we expect things to be easy and convenient. So it's no surprise that people are drawn to a fitness trend that requires minimal effort and can be done from the comfort of their own homes. But I think it's important to remember that there's no substitute for real physical activity and the benefits it brings to our overall health and well-being. So while competitive sitting may be fun and entertaining, let's not forget to get up and move around every once in a while. *stands up from chair and stretches*\n",

      "(Jon Stewart): It's clear that competitive sitting has sparked some interesting discussions and perspectives. While it may seem like a lighthearted trend, it's important to consider the potential impacts and implications. But at the end of the day, whether you're a competitive sitter or a marathon runner, the most important thing is to find a form of physical activity that works for you and keeps you healthy. That's a great point, Ronny. Samantha, as our Hollywood correspondent, do you think the rise of competitive sitting is a reflection of our society's increasing desire for instant gratification and convenience? Or is there something deeper at play here?\n",

      "(Samantha Bee): Oh, Jon, you know I love a good conspiracy theory. And let me tell you, I think there's something more sinister at play here. I mean, think about it - what if the government is behind this whole competitive sitting trend? They want us to be lazy and complacent so we don't question their actions. It's like the ultimate mind control. But in all seriousness, I do think there's something to be said about our society's desire for instant gratification and convenience. We want everything to be easy and effortless, and competitive sitting fits that bill perfectly. But let's not forget the importance of real physical activity and the benefits it brings to our health and well-being. *stands up from chair and does a few stretches*\n",

      "(Jon Stewart): Well, it's clear that competitive sitting has sparked some interesting discussions and perspectives. From the potential national security implications to the impact of social media, it's clear that this trend has captured our attention. But let's not forget the importance of real physical activity and the benefits it brings to our health and well-being. Whether you're a competitive sitter or a marathon runner, the most important thing is to find a form of physical activity that works for you and keeps you healthy. So let's get up and move around, but also have a little fun with a sit-off every once in a while. Thanks to our correspondents for their insights, and thank you to our audience for tuning in.\n",
