# Discord

>[Discord](https://discord.com/) is a VoIP and instant messaging social platform. Users have the ability to communicate 
> with voice calls, video calls, text messaging, media and files in private chats or as part of communities called 
> "servers". A server is a collection of persistent chat rooms and voice channels which can be accessed via invite links.
