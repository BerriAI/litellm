# Motherduck

>[Motherduck](https://motherduck.com/) is a managed DuckDB-in-the-cloud service.

## Installation and Setup

First, you need to install `duckdb` python package.

```bash
pip install duckdb
```

You will also need to sign up for an account at [Motherduck](https://motherduck.com/)

After that, you should set up a connection string - we mostly integrate with Motherduck through SQLAlchemy.
The connection string is likely in the form:

```
token="..."

conn_str = f"duckdb:///md:{token}@my_db"
```

## SQLChain

You can use the SQLChain to query data in your Motherduck instance in natural language.

```
from langchain import OpenAI, SQLDatabase, SQLDatabaseChain
db = SQLDatabase.from_uri(conn_str)
db_chain = SQLDatabaseChain.from_llm(OpenAI(temperature=0), db, verbose=True)
```

From here, see the [SQL Chain](/docs/use_cases/tabular/sqlite.html) documentation on how to use.


## LLMCache

You can also easily use Motherduck to cache LLM requests.
Once again this is done through the SQLAlchemy wrapper.

```
import sqlalchemy
eng = sqlalchemy.create_engine(conn_str)
langchain.llm_cache = SQLAlchemyCache(engine=eng)
```

From here, see the [LLM Caching](/docs/modules/model_io/models/llms/how_to/llm_caching) documentation on how to use.
