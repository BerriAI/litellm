# ForefrontAI

This page covers how to use the ForefrontAI ecosystem within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific ForefrontAI wrappers.

## Installation and Setup
- Get an ForefrontAI api key and set it as an environment variable (`FOREFRONTAI_API_KEY`)

## Wrappers

### LLM

There exists an ForefrontAI LLM wrapper, which you can access with 
```python
from langchain.llms import ForefrontAI
```
