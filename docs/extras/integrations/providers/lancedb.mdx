# LanceDB

This page covers how to use [LanceDB](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb) within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific LanceDB wrappers.

## Installation and Setup

- Install the Python SDK with `pip install lancedb`

## Wrappers

### VectorStore

There exists a wrapper around LanceDB databases, allowing you to use it as a vectorstore,
whether for semantic search or example selection.

To import this vectorstore:

```python
from langchain.vectorstores import LanceDB
```

For a more detailed walkthrough of the LanceDB wrapper, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/lancedb.html)
