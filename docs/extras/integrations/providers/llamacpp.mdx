# Llama.cpp

This page covers how to use [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific Llama-cpp wrappers.

## Installation and Setup
- Install the Python package with `pip install llama-cpp-python`
- Download one of the [supported models](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp#description) and convert them to the llama.cpp format per the [instructions](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)

## Wrappers

### LLM

There exists a LlamaCpp LLM wrapper, which you can access with 
```python
from langchain.llms import LlamaCpp
```
For a more detailed walkthrough of this, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/llms/llamacpp.html)

### Embeddings

There exists a LlamaCpp Embeddings wrapper, which you can access with 
```python
from langchain.embeddings import LlamaCppEmbeddings
```
For a more detailed walkthrough of this, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/llamacpp.html)
