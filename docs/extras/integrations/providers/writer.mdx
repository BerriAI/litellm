# Writer

This page covers how to use the Writer ecosystem within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific Writer wrappers.

## Installation and Setup
- Get an Writer api key and set it as an environment variable (`WRITER_API_KEY`)

## Wrappers

### LLM

There exists an Writer LLM wrapper, which you can access with 
```python
from langchain.llms import Writer
```
