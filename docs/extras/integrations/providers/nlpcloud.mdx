# NLPCloud

This page covers how to use the NLPCloud ecosystem within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific NLPCloud wrappers.

## Installation and Setup
- Install the Python SDK with `pip install nlpcloud`
- Get an NLPCloud api key and set it as an environment variable (`NLPCLOUD_API_KEY`)

## Wrappers

### LLM

There exists an NLPCloud LLM wrapper, which you can access with 
```python
from langchain.llms import NLPCloud
```
