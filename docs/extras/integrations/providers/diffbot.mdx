# Diffbot

>[Diffbot](https://docs.diffbot.com/docs) is a service to read web pages. Unlike traditional web scraping tools, 
> `Diffbot` doesn't require any rules to read the content on a page.
>It starts with computer vision, which classifies a page into one of 20 possible types. Content is then interpreted by a machine learning model trained to identify the key attributes on a page based on its type.
>The result is a website transformed into clean-structured data (like JSON or CSV), ready for your application.
