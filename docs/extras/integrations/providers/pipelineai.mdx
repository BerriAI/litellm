# PipelineAI

This page covers how to use the PipelineAI ecosystem within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific PipelineAI wrappers.

## Installation and Setup

- Install with `pip install pipeline-ai`
- Get a Pipeline Cloud api key and set it as an environment variable (`PIPELINE_API_KEY`)

## Wrappers

### LLM

There exists a PipelineAI LLM wrapper, which you can access with

```python
from langchain.llms import PipelineAI
```
