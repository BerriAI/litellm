# Airbyte

>[Airbyte](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte) is a data integration platform for ELT pipelines from APIs, 
> databases & files to warehouses & lakes. It has the largest catalog of ELT connectors to data warehouses and databases.

## Installation and Setup

This instruction shows how to load any source from `Airbyte` into a local `JSON` file that can be read in as a document.

**Prerequisites:**
Have `docker desktop` installed.

**Steps:**
1. Clone Airbyte from GitHub - `git clone https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte.git`.
2. Switch into Airbyte directory - `cd airbyte`.
3. Start Airbyte - `docker compose up`.
4. In your browser, just visit http://localhost:8000. You will be asked for a username and password. By default, that's username `airbyte` and password `password`.
5. Setup any source you wish.
6. Set destination as Local JSON, with specified destination path - lets say `/json_data`. Set up a manual sync.
7. Run the connection.
8. To see what files are created, navigate to: `file:///tmp/airbyte_local/`.
