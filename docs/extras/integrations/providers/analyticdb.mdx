# AnalyticDB

This page covers how to use the AnalyticDB ecosystem within LangChain.

### VectorStore

There exists a wrapper around AnalyticDB, allowing you to use it as a vectorstore,
whether for semantic search or example selection.

To import this vectorstore:
```python
from langchain.vectorstores import AnalyticDB
```

For a more detailed walkthrough of the AnalyticDB wrapper, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/analyticdb.html)
