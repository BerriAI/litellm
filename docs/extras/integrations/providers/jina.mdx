# Jina

This page covers how to use the Jina ecosystem within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific Jina wrappers.

## Installation and Setup
- Install the Python SDK with `pip install jina`
- Get a Jina AI Cloud auth token from [here](https://cloud.jina.ai/settings/tokens) and set it as an environment variable (`JINA_AUTH_TOKEN`)

## Wrappers

### Embeddings

There exists a Jina Embeddings wrapper, which you can access with 
```python
from langchain.embeddings import JinaEmbeddings
```
For a more detailed walkthrough of this, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/jina.html)

## Deployment

[Langchain-serve](https://github.com/jina-ai/langchain-serve), powered by Jina, helps take LangChain apps to production with easy to use REST/WebSocket APIs and Slack bots. 

### Usage

Install the package from PyPI. 

```bash
pip install langchain-serve
```

Wrap your LangChain app with the `@serving` decorator. 

```python
# app.py
from lcserve import serving

@serving
def ask(input: str) -> str:
    from langchain import LLMChain, OpenAI
    from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, ZeroShotAgent
    
    tools = [...] # list of tools
    prompt = ZeroShotAgent.create_prompt(
        tools, input_variables=["input", "agent_scratchpad"],
    )
    llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), prompt=prompt)
    agent = ZeroShotAgent(
        llm_chain=llm_chain, allowed_tools=[tool.name for tool in tools]
    )
    agent_executor = AgentExecutor.from_agent_and_tools(
        agent=agent, 
        tools=tools, 
        verbose=True,
    )
    return agent_executor.run(input)
```

Deploy on Jina AI Cloud with `lc-serve deploy jcloud app`. Once deployed, we can send a POST request to the API endpoint to get a response.

```bash
curl -X 'POST' 'https://<your-app>.wolf.jina.ai/ask' \
 -d '{
  "input": "Your Quesion here?",
  "envs": {
     "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-***"
  }
}'
```

You can also self-host the app on your infrastructure with Docker-compose or Kubernetes. See [here](https://github.com/jina-ai/langchain-serve#-self-host-llm-apps-with-docker-compose-or-kubernetes) for more details.


Langchain-serve also allows to deploy the apps with WebSocket APIs and Slack Bots both on [Jina AI Cloud](https://cloud.jina.ai/) or self-hosted infrastructure.
