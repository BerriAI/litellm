Prior periods have \\nbeen recast to reflect the revised presentation and are shown in Recast Historical Segment Results below .\\nAs announced on April 20, 2023 , we are bringing together part of Google Research (the Brain Team) and DeepMind \\nto significantly accelerate our progress in AI.

The ramp of our 40 GWh Megapack factory in Lathrop, California has been successful with still more room to reach full capacity. This Megapack factory will be the first of many. We recently announced our second 40 GWh Megafactory, this time in Shanghai, with construction starting later this year. \\nSolar\\nSolar deployments increased by 40% YoY in Q1 to 67 MW, but declined sequentially in \\nthe quarter, predominantly due to volatile weather and other factors. In addition, the solar industry has been impacted by supply chain challenges.\\nServices and Other\\nBoth revenue and gross profit from Services and Other reached an all -time high in Q1 \\n2023. Within this business division, growth of used vehicle sales remained strong YoY and had healthy margins. Supercharging, while still a relatively small part of the business, continued to grow as we gradually open up the network to non- Tesla \\nvehicles. \\n-4%-2%0%2%4%6%8%\\nQ3'21 Q4'21 Q1'22 Q2'22 Q3'22 Q4'22 Q1'23\\n\\nIn millions of USD or shares as applicable, except per share data Q1-2022 Q2-2022 Q3-2022 Q4-2022 Q1-2023\\nREVENUES\\nAutomotive sales 15,514 13,670 17,785 20,241 18,878 \\nAutomotive regulatory credits 679 344 286 467 521 \\nAutomotive leasing 668 588 621 599 564 \\nTotal automotive revenues 16,861 14,602 18,692 21,307 19,963 \\nEnergy generation and storage 616 866 1,117 1,310 1,529 \\nServices and other 1,279 1,466 1,645 1,701 1,837 \\nTotal revenues 18,756 16,934 21,454 24,318 23,329 \\nCOST OF REVENUES\\nAutomotive sales 10,914 10,153 13,099 15,433 15,422 \\nAutomotive leasing 408 368 381 352 333 \\nTotal automotive cost of revenues 11,322 10,521 13,480 15,785 15,755 \\nEnergy generation and storage 688 769 1,013 1,151 1,361 \\nServices and other 1,286 1,410 1,579 1,605 1,702 \\nTotal cost of revenues 13,296 12,700 16,072 18,541 18,818 \\nGross profit 5,460 4,234 5,382 5,777 4,511 \\nOPERATING EXPENSES\\nResearch and development 865 667 733 810 771 \\nSelling, general and administrative 992 961 961 1,032 1,076 \\nRestructuring and other — 142 — 34 —\\nTotal operating expenses 1,857 1,770 1,694 1,876 1,847 \\nINCOME FROM OPERATIONS 3,603 2,464 3,688 3,901 2,664 \\nInterest income 28 26 86 157 213 \\nInterest expense (61) (44) (53) (33) (29)\\nOther income (expense), net 56 28 (85) (42) (48)\\nINCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 3,626 2,474 3,636 3,983 2,800 \\nProvision for income taxes 346 205 305 276 261 \\nNET INCOME 3,280 2,269 3,331 3,707 2,539 \\nNet (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in \\nsubsidiaries(38) 10 39 20 26 \\nNET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS 3,318 2,259 3,292 3,687 2,513 \\nNet income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders(1)\\nBasic $        1.07 $        0.73 $        1.05 $          1.18 $       0.80 \\nDiluted $       0.95 $        0.65 $       0.95 $         1.07 $       0.73 \\nWeighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock(1)\\nBasic 3,103 3,111 3,146 3,160 3,166\\nDiluted 3,472 3,464 3,468 3,471 3,468\\nS T A T E M E N T   O F   O P E R A T I O N S\\n(Unaudited)\\n23 (1) Prior period results have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the three -for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock d ividend in August 2022.\\n\\nQ1-2022 Q2-2022 Q3-2022 Q4-2022 Q1-2023 YoY\\nModel S/X production 14,218 16,411 19,935 20,613 19,437 37%\\nModel 3/Y production 291,189 242,169 345,988 419,088 421,371 45%\\nTotal production 305,407 258,580 365,923 439,701 440,808 44%\\nModel S/X deliveries 14,724 16,162 18,672 17,147 10,695 -27%\\nModel 3/Y deliveries 295,324 238,533 325,158 388,131 412,180 40%\\nTotal deliveries 310,048 254,695 343,830 405,278 422,875 36%\\nof which subject to operating lease accounting 12,167 9,227 11,004 15,184 22,357 84%\\nTotal end of quarter operating lease vehicle count 128,402 131,756 135,054 140,667 153,988 20%\\nGlobal vehicle inventory (days of supply )(1)3 4 8 13 15 400%\\nSolar deployed (MW) 48 106 94 100 67 40%\\nStorage deployed (MWh) 846 1,133 2,100 2,462 3,889 360%\\nTesla locations(2)787 831 903 963 1,000 27%\\nMobile service fleet 1,372 1,453 1,532 1,584 1,692 23%\\nSupercharger stations 3,724 3,971 4,283 4,678 4,947 33%\\nSupercharger connectors 33,657 36,165 38,883 42,419 45,169 34%\\n(1)Days of supply is calculated by dividing new car ending inventory by the relevant quarter’s deliveries and using 75 trading days (aligned with Automotive News definition).\\n(2)Starting in Q1 -2023, we revised our methodology for reporting Tesla’s physical footprint.
