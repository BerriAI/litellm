    "Enterprise Search lets organizations quickly build generative AI powered search engines for customers and employees.Enterprise Search is underpinned by a variety of Google Search technologies, including semantic search, which helps deliver more relevant results than traditional keyword-based search techniques by using natural language processing and machine learning techniques to infer relationships within the content and intent from the user’s query input. Enterprise Search also benefits from Google’s expertise in understanding how users search and factors in content relevance to order displayed results. \n",

    "The Enterprise Search retriever is implemented in the `langchain.retriever.GoogleCloudEntepriseSearchRetriever` class. The `get_relevan_documents` method returns a list of `langchain.schema.Document` documents where the `page_content` field of each document is populated with either an `extractive segment` or an `extractive answer` that matches a query. The `metadata` field is populated with metadata (if any) of a document from which the segments or answers were extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "An extractive answer is verbatim text that is returned with each search result. It is extracted directly from the original document. Extractive answers are typically displayed near the top of web pages to provide an end user with a brief answer that is contextually relevant to their query. Extractive answers are available for website and unstructured search.\n",
    "\n",
    "An extractive segment is verbatim text that is returned with each search result. An extractive segment is usually more verbose than an extractive answer. Extractive segments can be displayed as an answer to a query, and can be used to perform post-processing tasks and as input for large language models to generate answers or new text. Extractive segments are available for unstructured search.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about extractive segments and extractive answers refer to [product documentation](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/snippets).\n",

    "- `project_id` - Your Google Cloud PROJECT_ID\n",
    "- `search_engine_id` - The ID of the data store you want to use. \n",

    "You can also configure a number of optional parameters, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `max_documents` - The maximum number of documents used to provide extractive segments or extractive answers\n",
    "- `get_extractive_answers` - By default, the retriever is configured to return extractive segments. Set this field to `True` to return extractive answers\n",
    "- `max_extractive_answer_count` - The maximum number of extractive answers returned in each search result.\n",
    "    At most 5 answers will be returned\n",
    "- `max_extractive_segment_count` - The maximum number of extractive segments returned in each search result.\n",
    "    Currently one segment will be returned\n",
    "- `filter` - The filter expression that allows you filter the search results based on the metadata associated with the documents in the searched data store. \n",
    "- `query_expansion_condition` - Specification to determine under which conditions query expansion should occur.\n",
    "    0 - Unspecified query expansion condition. In this case, server behavior defaults to disabled.\n",
    "    1 - Disabled query expansion. Only the exact search query is used, even if SearchResponse.total_size is zero.\n",
