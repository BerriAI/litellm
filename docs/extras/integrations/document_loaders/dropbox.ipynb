In lectures at the Newton Institute in June of 1993, Andrew Wiles announced a proof of a large part of the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture and, as a consequence, Fermat‚Äôs Last Theorem. This report for nonexperts dis- cusses the mathematics involved in Wiles‚Äô lectures, including the necessary background and the mathematical history.\\n\\n1\\n\\n] T N . h t a m\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nOn June 23, 1993, Andrew Wiles wrote on a blackboard, before an audience at the Newton Institute in Cambridge, England, that if p is a prime number, u, v, and w are rational numbers, and up + vp + wp = 0, then uvw = 0. In other words, he announced that he could prove Fermat‚Äôs Last Theorem. His announce- ment came at the end of his series of three talks entitled ‚ÄúModular forms, elliptic curves, and Galois representations‚Äù at the week-long workshop on ‚Äúp-adic Galois representations, Iwasawa theory, and the Tamagawa numbers of motives‚Äù.\\n\\n[\\n\\n1 v 0 2 2 7 0 4 9 / h t a m : v i X r a\\n\\nIn the margin of his copy of the works of Diophantus, next to a problem on\\n\\nPythagorean triples, Pierre de Fermat (1601‚Äì1665) wrote:\\n\\nCubum autem in duos cubos, aut quadratoquadratum in duos quadrato- quadratos, et generaliter nullam in inÔ¨Ånitum ultra quadratum potestatem in duos ejusdem nominis fas est dividere : cujus rei demonstrationem mirabilem sane detexi.

In this paper we will explain Wiles‚Äô work on elliptic curves and its connection with 1 we introduce elliptic curves and modularity, and Fermat‚Äôs Last Theorem. give the connection between Fermat‚Äôs Last Theorem and the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture on the modularity of elliptic curves. In 2 we describe how Wiles re- duces the proof of the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture to what we call the Modular Lifting Conjecture (which can be viewed as a weak form of the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture), by using a theorem of Langlands and Tunnell. In 4 we show ¬ß how the Semistable Modular Lifting Conjecture is related to a conjecture of Mazur on deformations of Galois representations (Conjecture 4.2), and in 5 we describe Wiles‚Äô method of attack on this conjecture. In order to make this survey as acces- sible as possible to nonspecialists, the more technical details are postponed as long as possible, some of them to the appendices.\\n\\nIn\\n\\n¬ß\\n\\n¬ß\\n\\n3 and ¬ß\\n\\n¬ß\\n\\nMuch of this report is based on Wiles‚Äô lectures in Cambridge. The authors apol- ogize for any errors we may have introduced. We also apologize to those whose mathematical contributions we, due to our incomplete understanding, do not prop- erly acknowledge.\\n\\nThe ideas Wiles introduced in his Cambridge lectures will have an important inÔ¨Çuence on research in number theory. Because of the great interest in this subject and the lack of a publicly available manuscript, we hope this report will be useful to the mathematics community. In early December 1993, shortly before this paper went to press, Wiles announced that ‚Äúthe Ô¨Ånal calculation of a precise upper bound for the Selmer group in the semistable case‚Äù (see 5.4 below) ‚Äúis not yet ¬ß complete as it stands,‚Äù but that he believes he will be able to Ô¨Ånish it in the near future using the ideas explained in his Cambridge lectures. While Wiles‚Äô proof of Theorem 5.3 below and Fermat‚Äôs Last Theorem depends on the calculation he referred to in his December announcement, Theorem 5.4 and Corollary 5.5 do not. Wiles‚Äô work provides for the Ô¨Årst time inÔ¨Ånitely many modular elliptic curves over the rational numbers which are not isomorphic over the complex numbers (see 5.5 for an explicit inÔ¨Ånite family).\\n\\n5.3 and\\n\\n¬ß\\n\\n¬ß\\n\\nNotation. The integers, rational numbers, complex numbers, and p-adic integers will be denoted Z, Q, C, and Zp, respectively. If F is a Ô¨Åeld, then ¬ØF denotes an algebraic closure of F .\\n\\n1. Connection between Fermat‚Äôs Last Theorem and elliptic curves\\n\\n1.1. Fermat‚Äôs Last Theorem follows from modularity of elliptic curves. Suppose Fermat‚Äôs Last Theorem were false. Then there would exist nonzero integers a, b, c, and n > 2 such that an + bn = cn. It is easy to see that no generality is lost by assuming that n is a prime greater than three (or greater than four million, by [2]; see [14] for n = 3 and 4) and that a and b are relatively prime. Write down the cubic curve:\\n\\ny2 = x(x + an)(x\\n\\nbn).\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n‚àí\\n\\nA REPORT ON WILES‚Äô CAMBRIDGE LECTURES\\n\\n3\\n\\n1.4 we will explain what it means for an elliptic curve to be modular. Kenneth Ribet [27] proved that if n is a prime greater than three, a, b, and c are nonzero integers, and an + bn = cn, then the elliptic curve (1) is not modular. But the results announced by Wiles imply the following.\\n\\nIn\\n\\n1.3 we will see that such curves are elliptic curves, and in\\n\\n¬ß\\n\\n¬ß\\n\\nTheorem 1.1 (Wiles). If A and B are distinct, nonzero, relatively prime integers, and AB(A\\n\\nB) is divisible by 16, then the elliptic curve\\n\\n‚àí\\n\\ny2 = x(x + A)(x + B)\\n\\nis modular.\\n\\nbn with a, b, c, and n coming from our hypothetical solution to a Fermat equation as above, we see that the conditions of Theorem 1.1 are satisÔ¨Åed since n 5 and one of a, b, and c is even. Thus Theorem 1.1 and Ribet‚Äôs result together imply Fermat‚Äôs Last Theorem!\\n\\nTaking A = an and B =\\n\\n‚àí\\n\\n‚â•\\n\\n1.2. History. The story of the connection between Fermat‚Äôs Last Theorem and elliptic curves begins in 1955, when Yutaka Taniyama (1927‚Äì1958) posed problems which may be viewed as a weaker version of the following conjecture (see [38]).\\n\\nTaniyama-Shimura Conjecture. Every elliptic curve over Q is modular.\\n\\nThe conjecture in the present form was made by Goro Shimura around 1962‚Äì64 and has become better understood due to work of Shimura [33‚Äì37] and of Andr¬¥e Weil [42] (see also [7]). The Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture is one of the major conjectures in number theory.\\n\\nBeginning in the late 1960s [15‚Äì18], Yves Hellegouarch connected Fermat equa- tions an + bn = cn with elliptic curves of the form (1) and used results about Fer- mat‚Äôs Last Theorem to prove results about elliptic curves. The landscape changed abruptly in 1985 when Gerhard Frey stated in a lecture at Oberwolfach that elliptic curves arising from counterexamples to Fermat‚Äôs Last Theorem could not be mod- ular [11]. Shortly thereafter Ribet [27] proved this, following ideas of Jean-Pierre Serre [32] (see [24] for a survey). In other words, ‚ÄúTaniyama-Shimura Conjecture\\n\\nFermat‚Äôs Last Theorem‚Äù. Thus, the stage was set. A proof of the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture (or enough of it to know that elliptic curves coming from Fermat equations are modular) would be a proof of Fermat‚Äôs Last Theorem.\\n\\n‚áí\\n\\n1.3. Elliptic curves.\\n\\nDeÔ¨Ånition. An elliptic curve over Q is a nonsingular curve deÔ¨Åned by an equation of the form\\n\\ny2 + a1xy + a3y = x3 + a2x2 + a4x + a6\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nwhere the coeÔ¨Écients ai are integers. The solution ( on the elliptic curve.\\n\\n, ‚àû\\n\\n) will be viewed as a point\\n\\n‚àû\\n\\n4\\n\\nK. RUBIN AND A. SILVERBERG\\n\\nRemarks. (i) A singular point on a curve f (x, y) = 0 is a point where both partial derivatives vanish. A curve is nonsingular if it has no singular points.\\n\\n(ii) Two elliptic curves over Q are isomorphic if one can be obtained from the other by changing coordinates x = A2x‚Ä≤ + B, y = A3y‚Ä≤ + Cx‚Ä≤ + D, with A, B, C, D\\n\\nQ and dividing through by A6.\\n\\n‚àà (iii) Every elliptic curve over Q is isomorphic to one of the form\\n\\ny2 = x3 + a2x2 + a4x + a6\\n\\nwith integers ai. A curve of this form is nonsingular if and only if the cubic on the right side has no repeated roots.\\n\\nExample. The equation y2 = x(x + 32)(x\\n\\n42) deÔ¨Ånes an elliptic curve over Q.\\n\\n‚àí\\n\\n1.4. Modularity. Let H denote the complex upper half plane C : Im(z) > 0 } where Im(z) is the imaginary part of z. If N is a positive integer, deÔ¨Åne a group of matrices\\n\\nz\\n\\n{\\n\\n‚àà\\n\\na b c d\\n\\nSL2(Z) : c is divisible by N\\n\\n.\\n\\nŒì0(N ) =\\n\\n‚àà\\n\\n(z) = az+b The group Œì0(N ) acts on H by linear fractional transformations cz+d . (cid:9) (cid:1) The quotient space H/Œì0(N ) is a (noncompact) Riemann surface. It can be com- pleted to a compact Riemann surface, denoted X0(N ), by adjoining a Ô¨Ånite set of points called cusps. The cusps are the Ô¨Ånitely many equivalence classes of Q ‚àû} under the action of Œì0(N ) (see Chapter 1 of [35]). The complex points of an elliptic curve can also be viewed as a compact Riemann surface.\\n\\na b c d\\n\\n(cid:8)(cid:0)\\n\\n(cid:1)\\n\\n(cid:0)\\n\\ni\\n\\n‚à™{\\n\\nDeÔ¨Ånition. An elliptic curve E is modular if, for some integer N , there is a holo- morphic map from X0(N ) onto E.\\n\\nExample.

An elliptic curve over Q is semistable at the prime q if it is isomorphic to an elliptic curve over Q which modulo q either is nonsingular or has a singu- lar point with two distinct tangent directions. An elliptic curve over Q is called semistable if it is semistable at every prime.\\n\\nExample.

If A and B are distinct, nonzero, relatively prime integers, write EA,B for the elliptic curve deÔ¨Åned by y2 = x(x + A)(x + B). Since EA,B and E‚àíA,‚àíB are isomorphic over the complex numbers (i.e., as Riemann surfaces), EA,B is modular if and only if E‚àíA,‚àíB is modular. If further AB(A B) is divisible by 16, then either EA,B or E‚àíA,‚àíB is semistable (this is easy to check directly; see for example I.1 of [24]). The Semistable Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture now implies that both ¬ß EA,B and E‚àíA,‚àíB are modular, and thus implies Theorem 1.1.\\n\\n‚àí\\n\\nRemark .

The task now is to construct an Euler system of cohomology classes with which to bound #(SD(Vn)) using Kolyvagin‚Äôs method. This is the most technically diÔ¨Écult part of Wiles‚Äô proof and is the part of Wiles‚Äô work he referred to as not yet complete in his December announcement.

Wiles (following Flach) constructs his cohomology classes from modular units, i.e., meromorphic functions on modular curves which are holo- morphic and nonzero away from the cusps. More precisely, Œ∫( ) comes from an explicit function on the modular curve X1(L, N ), the curve obtained by taking the quotient space of the upper half plane by the action of the group\\n\\nL\\n\\na b c d\\n\\nSL2(Z) : c\\n\\n1 (mod L) } ‚â° ‚Ñì‚ààL ‚Ñì and where N is the N of (T2) of\\n\\n0\\n\\n(mod LN ),\\n\\na\\n\\nd\\n\\n,\\n\\nŒì1(L, N ) =\\n\\n‚àà\\n\\n‚â°\\n\\n‚â°\\n\\n{ (cid:1) (cid:0) and adjoining the cusps, where L = The construction and study of the classes Œ∫( [8], [9] and others.\\n\\n4.2. ) rely heavily on results of Faltings\\n\\n¬ß\\n\\nL\\n\\nQ\\n\\n5.5. Wiles‚Äô results. Wiles announced two main results (Theorems 5.3 and 5.4 below) in the direction of Mazur‚Äôs conjecture, under two diÔ¨Äerent sets of hypotheses on the representation ¬ØœÅ. Theorem 5.3 implies the Semistable Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture and Fermat‚Äôs Last Theorem. Wiles‚Äô proof of Theorem 5.3 depends on the not-yet-complete construction of an appropriate Euler system (as in 5.4), while his proof of Theorem 5.4 (though not yet fully checked) does not. For Theorem 5.4, Wiles bounds the Selmer group of 5.2 without constructing a new Euler system, by using results from the Iwasawa theory of imaginary quadratic Ô¨Åelds.

Some details on the proof of Proposition 2.4\\n\\nB.1. The modular curve X0(15) can be viewed as a curve deÔ¨Åned over Q in such a way that the noncusp rational points correspond to isomorphism classes (over C) E( ¬ØQ) is a subgroup of pairs (E‚Ä≤, 42), of order 15 stable under GQ. An equation for X0(15) is y2 = x(x + 32)(x the elliptic curve discussed in 1. There are eight rational points on X0(15), four of ¬ß which are cusps. There are four modular elliptic curves, corresponding to a modular form for Œì0(50) (see p. 86 of [1]), which lie in the four distinct C-isomorphism classes that correspond to the noncusp rational points on X0(15).\\n\\n) where E‚Ä≤ is an elliptic curve over Q and\\n\\nC\\n\\nC ‚äÇ\\n\\n‚àí\\n\\nTherefore every elliptic curve over Q with a GQ-stable subgroup of order 15 is modular. Equivalently, if E is an elliptic curve over Q and both ¬ØœÅE,3 and ¬ØœÅE,5 are reducible, then E is modular.\\n\\nB.2. Fix a semistable elliptic curve E over Q. We will show that there are inÔ¨Ånitely many semistable elliptic curves E‚Ä≤ over Q such that\\n\\n(i) ¬ØœÅE‚Ä≤,5 is isomorphic to ¬ØœÅE,5, and (ii) ¬ØœÅE‚Ä≤,3 is irreducible.

We want to show that inÔ¨Ånitely many of these points correspond to semistable elliptic curves E‚Ä≤ with ¬ØœÅE‚Ä≤,3 irreducible.\\n\\nThere is another modular curve ÀÜX deÔ¨Åned over Q, with a Ô¨Ånite set ÀÜS of cusps,\\n\\nwhich has the following properties.

The function Ô¨Åeld of X 0 is Q(t), and the function Ô¨Åeld of ÀÜX 0 is Q(t)[x]/f (t, x) where f (t, x) Q(t)[x] is irreducible and has degree 4 in x. If t‚Ä≤ Q is suÔ¨Éciently close 5-adically to the value of t which corresponds to E, then the corresponding elliptic curve is semistable at Q so that f (t1, x) is 5. By the Hilbert Irreducibility Theorem we can Ô¨Ånd a t1 ‚àà irreducible in Q[x]. It is possible to Ô¨Åx a prime ‚Ñì = 5 such that f (t1, x) has no roots modulo ‚Ñì. If t‚Ä≤ Q is suÔ¨Éciently close ‚Ñì-adically to t1, then f (t‚Ä≤, x) has no rational roots, and thus t‚Ä≤ corresponds to a rational point of X 0 which is not the image of a rational point of ÀÜX 0.
