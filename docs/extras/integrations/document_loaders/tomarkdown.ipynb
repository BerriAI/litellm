      "**LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model, but will also be:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. _Data-aware_: connect a language model to other sources of data\n",
      "\n",
      "2. _Agentic_: allow a language model to interact with its environment\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The LangChain framework is designed around these principles.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely conceptual guide to LangChain, see [here](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/). For the JavaScript documentation, see [here](https://js.langchain.com/docs/).\n",

      "\n",
      "These modules are the core abstractions which we view as the building blocks of any LLM-powered application.\n",
      "\n",
      "For each module LangChain provides standard, extendable interfaces. LanghChain also provides external integrations and even end-to-end implementations for off-the-shelf use.\n",
      "\n",
      "The docs for each module contain quickstart examples, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides.\n",
      "\n",
      "The modules are (from least to most complex):\n",
      "\n",
      "- [Models](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/models/): Supported model types and integrations.\n",
      "\n",
      "- [Prompts](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/prompts.html): Prompt management, optimization, and serialization.\n",
      "\n",
      "- [Memory](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/memory.html): Memory refers to state that is persisted between calls of a chain/agent.\n",
      "\n",
      "- [Indexes](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/data_connection.html): Language models become much more powerful when combined with application-specific data - this module contains interfaces and integrations for loading, querying and updating external data.\n",
      "\n",
      "- [Chains](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains.html): Chains are structured sequences of calls (to an LLM or to a different utility).\n",
      "\n",
      "- [Agents](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents.html): An agent is a Chain in which an LLM, given a high-level directive and a set of tools, repeatedly decides an action, executes the action and observes the outcome until the high-level directive is complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "- [Callbacks](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/callbacks/getting_started.html): Callbacks let you log and stream the intermediate steps of any chain, making it easy to observe, debug, and evaluate the internals of an application.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Use Cases [\\#](\\#use-cases \"Permalink to this headline\")\n",
      "\n",
      "Best practices and built-in implementations for common LangChain use cases:\n",
      "\n",
      "- [Autonomous Agents](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/autonomous_agents.html): Autonomous agents are long-running agents that take many steps in an attempt to accomplish an objective. Examples include AutoGPT and BabyAGI.\n",
      "\n",
      "- [Agent Simulations](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/agent_simulations.html): Putting agents in a sandbox and observing how they interact with each other and react to events can be an effective way to evaluate their long-range reasoning and planning abilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "- [Personal Assistants](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/personal_assistants.html): One of the primary LangChain use cases. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\n",
      "\n",
      "- [Question Answering](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/question_answering.html): Another common LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "- [Chatbots](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/chatbots.html): Language models love to chat, making this a very natural use of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "- [Querying Tabular Data](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/tabular.html): Recommended reading if you want to use language models to query structured data (CSVs, SQL, dataframes, etc).\n",
      "\n",
      "- [Code Understanding](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/code.html): Recommended reading if you want to use language models to analyze code.\n",
      "\n",
      "- [Interacting with APIs](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/apis.html): Enabling language models to interact with APIs is extremely powerful. It gives them access to up-to-date information and allows them to take actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "- [Extraction](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/extraction.html): Extract structured information from text.\n",
      "\n",
      "- [Summarization](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/summarization.html): Compressing longer documents. A type of Data-Augmented Generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "- [Evaluation](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/evaluation.html): Generative models are hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One promising approach is to use language models themselves to do the evaluation.\n",
