    "# Async API\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain provides async support for LLMs by leveraging the [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Async support is particularly useful for calling multiple LLMs concurrently, as these calls are network-bound. Currently, `OpenAI`, `PromptLayerOpenAI`, `ChatOpenAI`, `Anthropic` and `Cohere` are supported, but async support for other LLMs is on the roadmap.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `agenerate` method to call an OpenAI LLM asynchronously."
