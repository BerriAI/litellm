    "LangChain provides async support for Agents by leveraging the [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Async methods are currently supported for the following `Tools`: [`GoogleSerperAPIWrapper`](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/master/langchain/utilities/google_serper.py), [`SerpAPIWrapper`](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/master/langchain/serpapi.py), [`LLMMathChain`](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/master/langchain/chains/llm_math/base.py) and [`Qdrant`](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/master/langchain/vectorstores/qdrant.py). Async support for other agent tools are on the roadmap.\n",
    "\n",
    "For `Tool`s that have a `coroutine` implemented (the four mentioned above), the `AgentExecutor` will `await` them directly. Otherwise, the `AgentExecutor` will call the `Tool`'s `func` via `asyncio.get_event_loop().run_in_executor` to avoid blocking the main runloop.\n",
