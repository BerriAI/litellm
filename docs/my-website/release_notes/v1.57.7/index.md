## Langfuse Prompt Management 

Langfuse Prompt Management is being labelled as BETA. This allows us to iterate quickly on the feedback we're receiving, and making the status clearer to users. We expect to make this feature to be stable by next month (February 2025).

Changes:
- Include the client message in the LLM API Request. (Previously only the prompt template was sent, and the client message was ignored).
- Log the prompt template in the logged request (e.g. to s3/langfuse). 
- Log the 'prompt_id' and 'prompt_variables' in the logged request (e.g. to s3/langfuse).

## Team/Organization Management + UI Improvements

Managing teams and organizations on the UI is now easier. 

Changes:
- Support for editing user role within team on UI. 
- Support updating team member role to admin via api - `/team/member_update`
- Show team admins all keys for their team. 
- Add organizations with budgets
- Assign teams to orgs on the UI
- Auto-assign SSO users to teams

## Custom Prometheus Metrics

Define custom prometheus metrics, and track usage/latency/no. of requests against them

This allows for more fine-grained tracking - e.g. on prompt template passed in request metadata
