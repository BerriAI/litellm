# js-yaml CVE-2025-64718
# This vulnerability is not applicable because we've forced js-yaml to version 4.1.1
# via npm overrides in package.json. Trivy incorrectly reports this based on
# dependency requirements in the lockfile, but the actual installed version is 4.1.1.
# Verified with: npm list js-yaml
