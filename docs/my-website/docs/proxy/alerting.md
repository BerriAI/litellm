Works across: 
- [Slack](#quick-start)
- [Discord](#advanced---using-discord-webhooks)
- [Microsoft Teams](#advanced---using-ms-teams-webhooks)

## Quick Start

Set up a slack alert channel to receive alerts from proxy.

### Step 1: Add a Slack Webhook URL to env

Get a slack webhook url from https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks

You can also use Discord Webhooks, see [here](#using-discord-webhooks)


Set `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` in your proxy env to enable Slack alerts.

```bash
export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/services/<>/<>/<>"
```

### Step 2: Setup Proxy

```yaml
general_settings: 
    alerting: ["slack"]
    alerting_threshold: 300 # sends alerts if requests hang for 5min+ and responses take 5min+ 
```

Start proxy 
```bash
$ litellm --config /path/to/config.yaml
```


### Step 3: Test it!


```bash
curl -X GET 'http://0.0.0.0:4000/health/services?service=slack' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer sk-1234'
```

## Advanced - Redacting Messages from Alerts

By default alerts show the `messages/input` passed to the LLM. If you want to redact this from slack alerting set the following setting on your config


```shell
general_settings:
  alerting: ["slack"]
  alert_types: ["spend_reports"] 

litellm_settings:
  redact_messages_in_exceptions: True
```


## Advanced - Add Metadata to alerts 

Add alerting metadata to proxy calls for debugging. 

```python
import openai
client = openai.OpenAI(
    api_key="anything",
    base_url="http://0.0.0.0:4000"
)

# request sent to model set on litellm proxy, `litellm --model`
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages = [], 
    extra_body={
        "metadata": {
            "alerting_metadata": {
                "hello": "world"
            }
        }
    }
)
```

**Expected Response**

<Image img={require('../../img/alerting_metadata.png')}/>

## Advanced - Opting into specific alert types

Set `alert_types` if you want to Opt into only specific alert types

```shell
general_settings:
  alerting: ["slack"]
  alert_types: ["spend_reports"] 
```

All Possible Alert Types

```python
AlertType = Literal[
    "llm_exceptions",
    "llm_too_slow",
    "llm_requests_hanging",
    "budget_alerts",
    "db_exceptions",
    "daily_reports",
    "spend_reports",
    "cooldown_deployment",
    "new_model_added",
    "outage_alerts",
]

```


## Advanced - Using MS Teams Webhooks

MS Teams provides a slack compatible webhook url that you can use for alerting

##### Quick Start

1. [Get a webhook url](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook?tabs=newteams%2Cdotnet#create-an-incoming-webhook) for your Microsoft Teams channel 

2. Add it to your .env

```bash
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="https://berriai.webhook.office.com/webhookb2/...6901/IncomingWebhook/b55fa0c2a48647be8e6effedcd540266/e04b1092-4a3e-44a2-ab6b-29a0a4854d1d"
```

3. Add it to your litellm config 

```yaml
model_list: 
    model_name: "azure-model"
    litellm_params:
        model: "azure/gpt-35-turbo"
        api_key: "my-bad-key" # ðŸ‘ˆ bad key

general_settings: 
    alerting: ["slack"]
    alerting_threshold: 300 # sends alerts if requests hang for 5min+ and responses take 5min+ 
```

4. Run health check!

Call the proxy `/health/services` endpoint to test if your alerting connection is correctly setup.

```bash
curl --location 'http://0.0.0.0:4000/health/services?service=slack' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer sk-1234'
```


**Expected Response**

<Image img={require('../../img/ms_teams_alerting.png')}/>

## Advanced - Using Discord Webhooks

Discord provides a slack compatible webhook url that you can use for alerting

##### Quick Start

1. Get a webhook url for your discord channel 

2. Append `/slack` to your discord webhook - it should look like

```
"https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1240030362193760286/cTLWt5ATn1gKmcy_982rl5xmYHsrM1IWJdmCL1AyOmU9JdQXazrp8L1_PYgUtgxj8x4f/slack"
```

3. Add it to your litellm config 

```yaml
model_list: 
    model_name: "azure-model"
    litellm_params:
        model: "azure/gpt-35-turbo"
        api_key: "my-bad-key" # ðŸ‘ˆ bad key

general_settings: 
    alerting: ["slack"]
    alerting_threshold: 300 # sends alerts if requests hang for 5min+ and responses take 5min+ 

environment_variables:
    SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1240030362193760286/cTLWt5ATn1gKmcy_982rl5xmYHsrM1IWJdmCL1AyOmU9JdQXazrp8L1_PYgUtgxj8x4f/slack"
```


## Advanced - [BETA] Webhooks for Budget Alerts

**Note**: This is a beta feature, so the spec might change.

Set a webhook to get notified for budget alerts. 

1. Setup config.yaml

Add url to your environment, for testing you can use a link from [here](https://webhook.site/)

```bash
export WEBHOOK_URL="https://webhook.site/6ab090e8-c55f-4a23-b075-3209f5c57906"
```

Add 'webhook' to config.yaml
```yaml
general_settings: 
  alerting: ["webhook"] # ðŸ‘ˆ KEY CHANGE
```

2. Start proxy

```bash
litellm --config /path/to/config.yaml

# RUNNING on http://0.0.0.0:4000
```

3. Test it!

```bash
curl -X GET --location 'http://0.0.0.0:4000/health/services?service=webhook' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer sk-1234'
```

**Expected Response**

```bash
{
  "spend": 1, # the spend for the 'event_group'
  "max_budget": 0, # the 'max_budget' set for the 'event_group'

## Advanced - Region-outage alerting (âœ¨ Enterprise feature)

:::info
[Get a free 2-week license](https://forms.gle/P518LXsAZ7PhXpDn8)
:::

Setup alerts if a provider region is having an outage. 

```yaml
general_settings:
    alerting: ["slack"]
    alert_types: ["region_outage_alerts"] 
```

By default this will trigger if multiple models in a region fail 5+ requests in 1 minute. '400' status code errors are not counted (i.e. BadRequestErrors).

Control thresholds with: 

```yaml
general_settings:
    alerting: ["slack"]
    alert_types: ["region_outage_alerts"] 
    alerting_args:
        region_outage_alert_ttl: 60 # time-window in seconds
        minor_outage_alert_threshold: 5 # number of errors to trigger a minor alert
        major_outage_alert_threshold: 10 # number of errors to trigger a major alert
```
