# Rate Limit Manager
`RateLimitManager` allows you to maximize throughput while staying under rate limits. You can use RateLimitManager to submit a batch of completion jobs to execute

## Rate Limit Aware - acompletion()
### Usage
```python
handler = RateLimitManager(
    max_requests_per_minute = 60,
    max_tokens_per_minute = 20000
)

response =  await handler.acompletion(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo", 
    messages=[{
        "content": "Please provide a summary of the latest scientific discoveries."*10, 
        "role": "user"
    }]
)
```

### Using Rate Limit Aware Completion to make 5 async calls
```python
import asyncio
from litellm import RateLimitManager

## init RateLimitManager
handler = RateLimitManager(
    max_requests_per_minute = 60,
    max_tokens_per_minute = 200
)

# helper 
async def send_request():
    response =  await handler.acompletion(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo", 
        messages=[{

    )
    print("got a response", response)
    return response

# creating async tasks
tasks = []

for _ in range(4):
    tasks.append(send_request())

responses = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

for response in responses:
    print(response)
```

However, here are a few significant scientific discoveries from different fields in recent years:\n\n1. Gravitational Waves: In 2015, the LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) collaboration confirmed the existence of gravitational waves, a prediction of Einstein's theory of general relativity. Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of space-time caused by violent cosmic events like the collision of black holes or neutron stars.\n\n2. CRISPR Gene Editing: The CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technique has revolutionized genetic research. Its discovery in 2012 has allowed scientists to easily modify DNA, potentially opening new avenues for treating genetic diseases and developing more resilient crops.\n\n3. Exoplanets: The field of exoplanet research has rapidly expanded in recent years. Notably, the Kepler Space Telescope has discovered thousands of exoplanets, including rocky planets within the habitable zones of their stars, raising the possibilities for extraterrestrial life.\n\n4. Proxima Centauri b Astrophysical Team: In 2020, an international team of astronomers discovered a potentially habitable Earth-sized exoplanet, called Proxima Centauri b, orbiting the closest star to our solar system, Proxima Centauri.\n\n5. Quantum Supremacy: In 2019, Google claimed to have achieved quantum supremacy, using a quantum computer to solve a mathematical problem that would take thousands of years for classical computers to solve. This milestone showcases the potential of quantum computing for solving complex problems.\n\nIt is important to note that new scientific discoveries are made every day and the scientific community constantly advances our understanding of the world.
