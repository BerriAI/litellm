LiteLLM simplifies LLM API calls by mapping them all to the [OpenAI ChatCompletion format](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat). 

## basic usage 

By default we provide a free $10 key to try all providers supported on LiteLLM. 

```python
from litellm import completion

## set ENV variables
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-litellm-7_NPZhMGxY2GoHC59LgbDw" # [OPTIONAL] replace with your openai key
os.environ["COHERE_API_KEY"] = "sk-litellm-7_NPZhMGxY2GoHC59LgbDw" # [OPTIONAL] replace with your cohere key

messages = [{ "content": "Hello, how are you?","role": "user"}]

# openai call
response = completion(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=messages)

# cohere call
response = completion("command-nightly", messages)
```

## streaming

Same example from before. Just pass in `stream=True` in the completion args. 
```python
from litellm import completion

## set ENV variables
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "openai key"
os.environ["COHERE_API_KEY"] = "cohere key"

messages = [{ "content": "Hello, how are you?","role": "user"}]

# openai call
response = completion(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=messages, stream=True)

# cohere call
response = completion("command-nightly", messages, stream=True)

print(response)
```

## exception handling 

LiteLLM maps exceptions across all supported providers to the OpenAI exceptions. All our exceptions inherit from OpenAI's exception types, so any error-handling you have for that, should work out of the box with LiteLLM. 

```python 
from openai.errors import OpenAIError
from litellm import completion

os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = "bad-key"
try: 
    # some code 
    completion(model="claude-instant-1", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hey, how's it going?"}])
except OpenAIError as e:
    print(e)
```
