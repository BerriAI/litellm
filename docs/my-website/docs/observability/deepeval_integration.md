# üî≠ DeepEval - Open-Source Evals with Tracing

### What is DeepEval?
[DeepEval](https://deepeval.com) is an open-source evaluation framework for LLMs ([Github](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval)). 

### What is Confident AI?

[Confident AI](https://documentation.confident-ai.com) (the ***deepeval*** platfrom) offers an Observatory for teams to trace and monitor LLM applications. Think Datadog for LLM apps. The observatory allows you to:

- Detect and debug issues in your LLM applications in real-time
- Search and analyze historical generation data with powerful filters
- Collect human feedback on model responses
- Run evaluations to measure and improve performance
- Track costs and latency to optimize resource usage

litellm.success_callback = ["deepeval"]
litellm.failure_callback = ["deepeval"]

try:
    response = litellm.completion(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in San Francisco?"}
        ],
    )
except Exception as e:
