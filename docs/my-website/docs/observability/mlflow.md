# üîÅ MLflow - OSS LLM Observability and Evaluation

## What is MLflow?

**MLflow** is an end-to-end open source MLOps platform for [experiment tracking](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html), [model management](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html), [evaluation](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/llm-evaluate/index.html), [observability (tracing)](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html), and [deployment](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/deployment/index.html). MLflow empowers teams to collaboratively develop and refine LLM applications efficiently.

MLflow‚Äôs integration with LiteLLM supports advanced observability compatible with OpenTelemetry.

## Getting Started

Install MLflow:

```shell
pip install "litellm[mlflow]"
```

To enable MLflow auto tracing for LiteLLM:

```python
import mlflow

mlflow.litellm.autolog()

# Alternative, you can set the callback manually in LiteLLM
# litellm.callbacks = ["mlflow"]
```

Since MLflow is open-source and free, **no sign-up or API key is needed to log traces!**

```python
import litellm
import os

# Set your LLM provider's API key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = ""

# Call LiteLLM as usual
response = litellm.completion(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hi üëã - i'm openai"}
    ]
)
```

Open the MLflow UI and go to the `Traces` tab to view logged traces:

```bash
mlflow ui
```

## Tracing Tool Calls

MLflow integration with LiteLLM support tracking tool calls in addition to the messages.

```python
import mlflow

# Enable MLflow auto-tracing for LiteLLM
mlflow.litellm.autolog()

# Define the tool function.
def get_weather(location: str) -> str:
    if location == "Tokyo":
        return "sunny"
    elif location == "Paris":
        return "rainy"
    return "unknown"

# Define function spec
get_weather_tool = {
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
        "parameters": {
            "properties": {
                "location": {
                    "description": "The city and state, e.g., San Francisco, CA",
                    "type": "string",
                },
            },
            "required": ["location"],
            "type": "object",
        },
    },
}

# Call LiteLLM as usual
response = litellm.completion(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[
      {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in Paris today?"}
    ],
    tools=[get_weather_tool]
)
```

## Evaluation

MLflow LiteLLM integration allow you to run qualitative assessment against LLM to evaluate or/and monitor your GenAI application.

Visit [Evaluate LLMs Tutorial](../tutorials/eval_suites.md) for the complete guidance on how to run evaluation suite with LiteLLM and MLflow.


## Exporting Traces to OpenTelemetry collectors

MLflow traces are compatible with OpenTelemetry. You can export traces to any OpenTelemetry collector (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin, Datadog, New Relic) by setting the endpoint URL in the environment variables.

```
# Set the endpoint of the OpenTelemetry Collector
os.environ["OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT"] = "http://localhost:4317/v1/traces"
# Optionally, set the service name to group traces
os.environ["OTEL_SERVICE_NAME"] = "<your-service-name>"
```

See [MLflow documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html#using-opentelemetry-collector-for-exporting-traces) for more details.

## Combine LiteLLM Trace with Your Application Trace

LiteLLM is often part of larger LLM applications, such as agentic models. MLflow Tracing allows you to instrument custom Python code, which can then be combined with LiteLLM traces.

```python
import litellm
import mlflow
from mlflow.entities import SpanType

# Enable MLflow auto-tracing for LiteLLM
mlflow.litellm.autolog()


class CustomAgent:
    # Use @mlflow.trace to instrument Python functions.
    @mlflow.trace(span_type=SpanType.AGENT)
    def run(self, query: str):
        # do something

        while i < self.max_turns:
            response = litellm.completion(
                model="gpt-4o-mini",
                messages=messages,
            )

            action = self.get_action(response)
            ...

    @mlflow.trace
    def get_action(llm_response):
        ...
```

This approach generates a unified trace, combining your custom Python code with LiteLLM calls.

## LiteLLM Proxy Server 

### Dependencies

For using `mlflow` on LiteLLM Proxy Server, you need to install the `mlflow` package on your docker container.

```shell
pip install "mlflow>=3.1.4"
```

### Configuration

Configure MLflow in your LiteLLM proxy configuration file:

```yaml
model_list:
  - model_name: openai/*
    litellm_params:
      model: openai/*

litellm_settings:
  success_callback: ["mlflow"]
  failure_callback: ["mlflow"]
```

### Environment Variables

For MLflow with Databricks service, set these required environment variables:

```shell
DATABRICKS_TOKEN="dapixxxxx"
DATABRICKS_HOST="https://dbc-xxxx.cloud.databricks.com"
MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI="databricks"
MLFLOW_REGISTRY_URI="databricks-uc"
MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT_ID="xxxx"
```

### Adding Tags for Better Tracing

You can add custom tags to your requests for improved trace organization and filtering in MLflow. Tags help you categorize and search your traces by job ID, task name, or any custom metadata.

import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

curl --location 'http://0.0.0.0:4000/chat/completions' \

    --data '{

# Make a request with tags in metadata
response = client.chat.completions.create(

    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
