# Why Pass-Through Endpoints?

These endpoints are useful for 2 scenarios:

1. **Migrate existing projects** to litellm proxy. E.g: If you have users already in production with Anthropic's SDK, you just need to change te base url to get cost tracking/logging/budgets/etc. 


2. **Use provider-specific endpoints** E.g: If you want to use [Vertex AI's token counting endpoint](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/pass_through/vertex_ai#count-tokens-api)


## How is your request handled? 

The request is passed through to the provider's endpoint. The response is then passed back to the client. **No translation is done.**
