# Set up environment

Let's get the necessary keys to set up our demo environment.

Every LLM provider needs API keys (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`). You can get API keys from OpenAI, Cohere and AI21 **without a waitlist**.

Let's get them for our demo!

**OpenAI**: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys  
**Cohere**: https://dashboard.cohere.com/welcome/login?redirect_uri=%2Fapi-keys  (no credit card required)  
**AI21**: https://studio.ai21.com/account/api-key (no credit card required)
