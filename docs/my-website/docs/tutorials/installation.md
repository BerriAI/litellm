# Set up environment

Let's get the necessary keys to set up our demo environment.

## 1. Get your keys

Every LLM provider needs API keys (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`). For this demo, let's get the API Keys for OpenAI, Cohere, and AI21. 

**OpenAI**: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys  
**Cohere**: https://dashboard.cohere.com/welcome/login?redirect_uri=%2Fapi-keys  
**AI21**: https://studio.ai21.com/account/api-key
