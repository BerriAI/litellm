## Frequently Asked Questions

### What topics does Professional support cover and what SLAs do you offer?

Professional Support can assist with LLM/Provider integrations, deployment, upgrade management, and LLM Provider troubleshooting.  We canâ€™t solve your own infrastructure-related issues but we will guide you to fix them.

- 1 hour for Sev0 issues
- 6 hours for Sev1
- 24h for Sev2-Sev3 between 7am â€“ 7pm PT (Monday through Saturday)

**We can offer custom SLAs** based on your needs and the severity of the issue

### Whatâ€™s the cost of the Self-Managed Enterprise edition?

Self-Managed Enterprise deployments require our team to understand your exact needs. [Get in touch with us to learn more](https://calendly.com/d/4mp-gd3-k5k/litellm-1-1-onboarding-chat)


### How does deployment with Enterprise License work? 

You just deploy [our docker image](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/proxy/deploy) and get an enterprise license key to add to your environment to unlock additional functionality (SSO, Prometheus metrics, etc.). 

```env
LITELLM_LICENSE="eyJ..."
```

No data leaves your environment.
