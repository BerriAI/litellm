### How does deployment with Enterprise License work? 

You just deploy [our docker image](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/proxy/deploy) and get an enterprise license key to add to your environment to unlock additional functionality (SSO, Prometheus metrics, etc.). 

```env
LITELLM_LICENSE="eyJ..."
```

No data leaves your environment.
