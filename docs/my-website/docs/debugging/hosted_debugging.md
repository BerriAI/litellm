# Debugging Dashboard
LiteLLM offers a free UI to debug your calls + add new models at (https://admin.litellm.ai/). This is useful if you're testing your LiteLLM server and need to see if the API calls were made successfully **or** want to add new models without going into code. 

**Needs litellm>=0.1.438***

## Setup

Once created, your dashboard is viewable at - `admin.litellm.ai/<your_email>` [ðŸ‘‹ Tell us if you need better privacy controls](https://calendly.com/d/4mp-gd3-k5k/berriai-1-1-onboarding-litellm-hosted-version?month=2023-08)

You can set your user email in 2 ways.  
- By setting it on the module - `litellm.email=<your_email>`.
- By setting it as an environment variable - `os.environ["LITELLM_EMAIL"] = "your_email"`.
