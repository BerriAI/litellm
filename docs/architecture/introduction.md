# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for LiteLLM, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Status:** Existing Production Project

LiteLLM is an established, production-ready LLM gateway that has been actively developed and deployed. This architecture document reflects the current implementation while documenting planned enhancements, particularly the Moneta/Lago billing integration currently being developed.
