# Feature Proposal: Intelligent Cooldowns

## 1. Summary

This document details the analysis of the current implementation of retry logic in the LiteLLM proxy and proposes a new "intelligent cooldowns" system. The objective is to improve the robustness, configurability, and resilience of the system against different types of errors, especially in critical operations such as updating spend logs (`update_spend`).

## 2. Analysis of the Current Implementation

The existing retry logic is primarily located in the [`litellm/proxy/utils.py`](litellm/proxy/utils.py:0) file, within the static method `ProxyUpdateSpend.update_spend_logs`.

### Strengths

*   **Basic Functional Mechanism:** There is a retry logic that handles basic connection errors.
*   **Exponential Backoff:** It uses a simple exponential backoff strategy (`asyncio.sleep(2 ** retries)`), which is a standard starting point.

### Weaknesses

*   **Manual Implementation:** The logic is implemented with a manual `while` loop, instead of using the `backoff` library which is already a project dependency and is used in other parts of the same file.
*   **Limited Error Handling:** It only reacts to a predefined set of connection errors ([`DB_CONNECTION_ERROR_TYPES`](litellm/proxy/utils.py:27)). It does not distinguish between HTTP status codes, such as `429 Too Many Requests` or `5xx` server errors.
*   **Fixed Parameters:** The maximum number of retries is hardcoded (`retries < 3`), which limits flexibility.
*   **Absence of Jitter:** "Jitter" (randomness) is not applied to wait times, which could cause synchronized load spikes ("thundering herd") in a distributed system.

## 3. Improvement Proposal: Intelligent Cooldowns

It is proposed to refactor the current logic to be more robust, configurable, and adaptable to different error scenarios.

### 3.1. Adoption of the `backoff` Library

Replace the manual `while` loop with the `@backoff.on_exception` decorator. This will make the code more declarative, cleaner, and consistent with other parts of the project.

### 3.2. Introduction of Configurability

Expose the following parameters so they can be configured via environment variables or a central configuration object:

*   `max_tries`: Maximum number of retries.
*   `backoff_factor`: Multiplier for exponential wait.
*   `jitter`: Jitter algorithm to apply (e.g., `backoff.full_jitter`).

### 3.3. Intelligent Error Handling Logic

The new implementation should inspect the exception to make informed decisions:

*   **Rate Limit Errors (`HTTP 429`):** If the server response includes a `Retry-After` header, the system must respect it and use that value as the wait time, ignoring the backoff strategy.
*   **Transient Server Errors (`HTTP 5xx`):** For these errors, the "exponential backoff" strategy with jitter should be applied.
*   **Permanent Client Errors (`HTTP 4xx`, except `429`):** For these errors, the system **should not retry**, as the request will likely not succeed without modifications.

## 4. Flow Diagram of the Proposed Logic

graph TD
    A[Start operation] --> B{Did an error occur?};
    B -- No --> C[Success];
    B -- Yes --> D{Is it a 4xx series error?};
    D -- Yes --> E{Is it a 429 error (Rate Limit)?};
    D -- No --> F{Is it a 5xx series or connection error?};
    E -- Yes --> G{Does the response contain the 'Retry-After' header?};
    E -- No --> H[Apply exponential backoff + jitter];
    F -- Yes --> H;
    F -- No --> I[Do not retry, permanent failure];
    G -- Yes --> J[Wait for time indicated in 'Retry-After'];
    G -- No --> H;
    H --> K{Maximum retries reached?};
    J --> K;
    K -- No --> L[Retry operation];
    K -- Yes --> M[Definitive failure];
    L --> B;
```

## 5. Conclusion

The implementation of "intelligent cooldowns" will significantly improve the resilience and behavior of the LiteLLM proxy. This refactoring will reduce unnecessary load on dependent services, improve recovery from transient failures, and increase code maintainability and configurability.
