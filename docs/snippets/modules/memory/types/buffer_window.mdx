```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory
```


```python
memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory( k=1)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
memory.save_context({"input": "not much you"}, {"output": "not much"})
```


```python
memory.load_memory_variables({})
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    {'history': 'Human: not much you\nAI: not much'}
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

We can also get the history as a list of messages (this is useful if you are using this with a chat model).


```python
memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory( k=1, return_messages=True)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
memory.save_context({"input": "not much you"}, {"output": "not much"})
```


```python
memory.load_memory_variables({})
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    {'history': [HumanMessage(content='not much you', additional_kwargs={}),
      AIMessage(content='not much', additional_kwargs={})]}
```

</CodeOutputBlock>

## Using in a chain
Let's walk through an example, again setting `verbose=True` so we can see the prompt.


```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
conversation_with_summary = ConversationChain(
    llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), 
    # We set a low k=2, to only keep the last 2 interactions in memory
    memory=ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=2), 
    verbose=True
)
conversation_with_summary.predict(input="Hi, what's up?")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    
    
    > Entering new ConversationChain chain...
    Prompt after formatting:
    The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.
    
    Current conversation:
    
    Human: Hi, what's up?
    AI:
    
    > Finished chain.





    " Hi there! I'm doing great. I'm currently helping a customer with a technical issue. How about you?"
