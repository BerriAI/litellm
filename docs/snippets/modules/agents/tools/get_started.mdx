```python
from langchain.agents import load_tools
tool_names = [...]
tools = load_tools(tool_names)
```

Some tools (e.g. chains, agents) may require a base LLM to use to initialize them.
In that case, you can pass in an LLM as well:

```python
from langchain.agents import load_tools
tool_names = [...]
llm = ...
tools = load_tools(tool_names, llm=llm)
```
