]
```

## Planner, Executor, and Agent


```python
model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)
```


```python
planner = load_chat_planner(model)
```


```python
executor = load_agent_executor(model, tools, verbose=True)
```


```python
agent = PlanAndExecute(planner=planner, executor=executor, verbose=True)
