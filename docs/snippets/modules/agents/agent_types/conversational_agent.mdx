This is accomplished with a specific type of agent (`conversational-react-description`) which expects to be used with a memory component.

```python
from langchain.agents import Tool
from langchain.agents import AgentType
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain import OpenAI
from langchain.utilities import SerpAPIWrapper
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent
```


```python
search = SerpAPIWrapper()
tools = [
    Tool(
        name = "Current Search",
        func=search.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about current events or the current state of the world"
    ),
]
```


```python
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history")
```


```python
llm=OpenAI(temperature=0)
agent_chain = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True, memory=memory)
```


```python
agent_chain.run(input="hi, i am bob")
```
