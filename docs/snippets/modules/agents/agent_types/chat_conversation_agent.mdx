The `chat-conversational-react-description` agent type lets us create a conversational agent using a chat model instead of an LLM.

```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history", return_messages=True)
llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY, temperature=0)
agent_chain = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.CHAT_CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True, memory=memory)
```


```python
agent_chain.run(input="hi, i am bob")
```
