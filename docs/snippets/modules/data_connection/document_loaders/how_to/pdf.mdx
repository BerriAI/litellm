An advantage of this approach is that documents can be retrieved with page numbers.

We want to use `OpenAIEmbeddings` so we have to get the OpenAI API Key.


```python
import os
import getpass

os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = getpass.getpass('OpenAI API Key:')
```

## Using Unstructured


```python
from langchain.document_loaders import UnstructuredPDFLoader
```


```python
loader = UnstructuredPDFLoader("example_data/layout-parser-paper.pdf")
```


```python

### Retain Elements

Under the hood, Unstructured creates different "elements" for different chunks of text. By default we combine those together, but you can easily keep that separation by specifying `mode="elements"`.


```python
loader = UnstructuredPDFLoader("example_data/layout-parser-paper.pdf", mode="elements")
```


```python
data = loader.load()

### Fetching remote PDFs using Unstructured

This covers how to load online pdfs into a document format that we can use downstream. This can be used for various online pdf sites such as https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/ and https://arxiv.org/archive/

Note: all other pdf loaders can also be used to fetch remote PDFs, but `OnlinePDFLoader` is a legacy function, and works specifically with `UnstructuredPDFLoader`.



```python
from langchain.document_loaders import OnlinePDFLoader
```


```python
loader = OnlinePDFLoader("https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.03803.pdf")
```


```python
data = loader.load()

When p = d + 1 − s the proof relies on the Cayley trick, a trick which associates to X a quasi-smooth hypersurface Y in a projective vector bundle, and the Cayley Proposition (4.3) which gives an isomorphism of some primitive cohomologies (4.2) of X and Y . The Cayley trick, following the philosophy of Mavlyutov in [7], reduces results known for quasi-smooth hypersurfaces to quasi-smooth intersection subvarieties. The idea in this paper goes the other way around, we translate some results for quasi-smooth intersection subvarieties to\n\nAcknowledgement.

Moreover, T ∶ = N ⊗ Z C ∗ ≃ ( C ∗ ) d is the torus action on P d Σ . We denote by Σ ( i ) the i -dimensional cones\n\nFor a cone σ ∈ Σ, ˆ σ is the set of 1-dimensional cone in Σ that are not contained in σ\n\nand x ˆ σ ∶ = ∏ ρ ∈ ˆ σ x ρ is the associated monomial in S .\n\nDeﬁnition 2.2. The irrelevant ideal of P d Σ is the monomial ideal B Σ ∶ =< x ˆ σ ∣ σ ∈ Σ > and the zero locus Z ( Σ ) ∶ = V ( B Σ ) in the aﬃne space A d ∶ = Spec ( S ) is the irrelevant locus.\n\nProposition 2.3 (Theorem 5.1.11 [5]) . The toric variety P d Σ is a categorical quotient A d ∖ Z ( Σ ) by the group Hom ( Cl ( Σ ) , C ∗ ) and the group action is induced by the Cl ( Σ ) - grading of S .\n\nNow we give a brief introduction to complex orbifolds and we mention the needed theorems for the next section. Namely: de Rham theorem and Dolbeault theorem for complex orbifolds.\n\nDeﬁnition 2.4. A complex orbifold of complex dimension d is a singular complex space whose singularities are locally isomorphic to quotient singularities C d / G , for ﬁnite sub- groups G ⊂ Gl ( d, C ) .\n\nDeﬁnition 2.5. A diﬀerential form on a complex orbifold Z is deﬁned locally at z ∈ Z as a G -invariant diﬀerential form on C d where G ⊂ Gl ( d, C ) and Z is locally isomorphic to d\n\nRoughly speaking the local geometry of orbifolds reduces to local G -invariant geometry.\n\nWe have a complex of diﬀerential forms ( A ● ( Z ) , d ) and a double complex ( A ● , ● ( Z ) , ∂, ¯ ∂ ) of bigraded diﬀerential forms which deﬁne the de Rham and the Dolbeault cohomology groups (for a ﬁxed p ∈ N ) respectively:\n\n(1,1)-Lefschetz theorem for projective toric orbifolds\n\nDeﬁnition 3.1. A subvariety X ⊂ P d Σ is quasi-smooth if V ( I X ) ⊂ A #Σ ( 1 ) is smooth outside\n\nExample 3.2 . Quasi-smooth hypersurfaces or more generally quasi-smooth intersection sub-\n\nExample 3.2 . Quasi-smooth hypersurfaces or more generally quasi-smooth intersection sub- varieties are quasi-smooth subvarieties (see [2] or [7] for more details).\n\nRemark 3.3 . Quasi-smooth subvarieties are suborbifolds of P d Σ in the sense of Satake in [8]. Intuitively speaking they are subvarieties whose only singularities come from the ambient\n\nProof. From the exponential short exact sequence\n\nwe have a long exact sequence in cohomology\n\nH 1 (O ∗ X ) → H 2 ( X, Z ) → H 2 (O X ) ≃ H 0 , 2 ( X )\n\nwhere the last isomorphisms is due to Steenbrink in [9]. Now, it is enough to prove the commutativity of the next diagram\n\nwhere the last isomorphisms is due to Steenbrink in [9]. Now,\n\nH 2 ( X, Z ) / / H 2 ( X, O X ) ≃ Dolbeault H 2 ( X, C ) deRham ≃ H 2 dR ( X, C ) / / H 0 , 2 ¯ ∂ ( X )\n\nof the proof follows as the ( 1 , 1 ) -Lefschetz theorem in [6].\n\nRemark 3.5 . For k = 1 and P d Σ as the projective space, we recover the classical ( 1 , 1 ) - Lefschetz theorem.\n\nBy the Hard Lefschetz Theorem for projective orbifolds (see [11] for details) we\n\nBy the Hard Lefschetz Theorem for projective orbifolds (see [11] for details) we get an isomorphism of cohomologies :\n\ngiven by the Lefschetz morphism and since it is a morphism of Hodge structures, we have:\n\nH 1 , 1 ( X, Q ) ≃ H dim X − 1 , dim X − 1 ( X, Q )\n\nCorollary 3.6. If the dimension of X is 1 , 2 or 3 . The Hodge conjecture holds on X\n\nProof. If the dim C X = 1 the result is clear by the Hard Lefschetz theorem for projective orbifolds. The dimension 2 and 3 cases are covered by Theorem 3.5 and the Hard Lefschetz.\n\nCayley trick and Cayley proposition\n\nThe Cayley trick is a way to associate to a quasi-smooth intersection subvariety a quasi- smooth hypersurface. Let L 1 , . . . , L s be line bundles on P d Σ and let π ∶ P ( E ) → P d Σ be the projective space bundle associated to the vector bundle E = L 1 ⊕ ⋯ ⊕ L s . It is known that P ( E ) is a ( d + s − 1 ) -dimensional simplicial toric variety whose fan depends on the degrees of the line bundles and the fan Σ. Furthermore, if the Cox ring, without considering the grading, of P d Σ is C [ x 1 , . . . , x m ] then the Cox ring of P ( E ) is\n\nMoreover for X a quasi-smooth intersection subvariety cut oﬀ by f 1 , . . . , f s with deg ( f i ) = [ L i ] we relate the hypersurface Y cut oﬀ by F = y 1 f 1 + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ + y s f s which turns out to be quasi-smooth. For more details see Section 2 in [7].\n\nWe will denote P ( E ) as P d + s − 1 Σ ,X to keep track of its relation with X and P d Σ .\n\nThe following is a key remark.\n\nRemark 4.1 . There is a morphism ι ∶ X → Y ⊂ P d + s − 1 Σ ,X . Moreover every point z ∶ = ( x, y ) ∈ Y with y ≠ 0 has a preimage. Hence for any subvariety W = V ( I W ) ⊂ X ⊂ P d Σ there exists W ′ ⊂ Y ⊂ P d + s − 1 Σ ,X such that π ( W ′ ) = W , i.e., W ′ = { z = ( x, y ) ∣ x ∈ W } .\n\nFor X ⊂ P d Σ a quasi-smooth intersection variety the morphism in cohomology induced by the inclusion i ∗ ∶ H d − s ( P d Σ , C ) → H d − s ( X, C ) is injective by Proposition 1.4 in [7].\n\nDeﬁnition 4.2. The primitive cohomology of H d − s prim ( X ) is the quotient H d − s ( X, C )/ i ∗ ( H d − s ( P d Σ , C )) and H d − s prim ( X, Q ) with rational coeﬃcients.\n\nH d − s ( P d Σ , C ) and H d − s ( X, C ) have pure Hodge structures, and the morphism i ∗ is com- patible with them, so that H d − s prim ( X ) gets a pure Hodge structure.\n\nThe next Proposition is the Cayley proposition.\n\nProposition 4.3. [Proposition 2.3 in [3] ] Let X = X 1 ∩⋅ ⋅ ⋅∩ X s be a quasi-smooth intersec- tion subvariety in P d Σ cut oﬀ by homogeneous polynomials f 1 . . . f s . Then for p ≠ d + s − 1 2 , d + s − 3 2\n\nRemark 4.5 . The above isomorphisms are also true with rational coeﬃcients since H ● ( X, C ) = H ● ( X, Q ) ⊗ Q C . See the beginning of Section 7.1 in [10] for more details.\n\nTheorem 5.1. Let Y = { F = y 1 f 1 + ⋯ + y k f k = 0 } ⊂ P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X be the quasi-smooth hypersurface associated to the quasi-smooth intersection surface X = X f 1 ∩ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ∩ X f k ⊂ P k + 2 Σ . Then on Y the Hodge conjecture holds.\n\nthe Hodge conjecture holds.\n\nProof. If H k,k prim ( X, Q ) = 0 we are done. So let us assume H k,k prim ( X, Q ) ≠ 0. By the Cayley proposition H k,k prim ( Y, Q ) ≃ H 1 , 1 prim ( X, Q ) and by the ( 1 , 1 ) -Lefschetz theorem for projective\n\ntoric orbifolds there is a non-zero algebraic basis λ C 1 , . . . , λ C n with rational coeﬃcients of H 1 , 1 prim ( X, Q ) , that is, there are n ∶ = h 1 , 1 prim ( X, Q ) algebraic curves C 1 , . . . , C n in X such that under the Poincar´e duality the class in homology [ C i ] goes to λ C i , [ C i ] ↦ λ C i . Recall that the Cox ring of P k + 2 is contained in the Cox ring of P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X without considering the grading. Considering the grading we have that if α ∈ Cl ( P k + 2 Σ ) then ( α, 0 ) ∈ Cl ( P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X ) . So the polynomials deﬁning C i ⊂ P k + 2 Σ can be interpreted in P 2 k + 1 X, Σ but with diﬀerent degree. Moreover, by Remark 4.1 each C i is contained in Y = { F = y 1 f 1 + ⋯ + y k f k = 0 } and\n\nfurthermore it has codimension k .\n\nClaim: { C i } ni = 1 is a basis of prim ( ) . It is enough to prove that λ C i is diﬀerent from zero in H k,k prim ( Y, Q ) or equivalently that the cohomology classes { λ C i } ni = 1 do not come from the ambient space. By contradiction, let us assume that there exists a j and C ⊂ P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X such that λ C ∈ H k,k ( P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X , Q ) with i ∗ ( λ C ) = λ C j or in terms of homology there exists a ( k + 2 ) -dimensional algebraic subvariety V ⊂ P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X such that V ∩ Y = C j so they are equal as a homology class of P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X ,i.e., [ V ∩ Y ] = [ C j ] . It is easy to check that π ( V ) ∩ X = C j as a subvariety of P k + 2 Σ where π ∶ ( x, y ) ↦ x . Hence [ π ( V ) ∩ X ] = [ C j ] which is equivalent to say that λ C j comes from P k + 2 Σ which contradicts the choice of [ C j ] .\n\nRemark 5.2 . Into the proof of the previous theorem, the key fact was that on X the Hodge conjecture holds and we translate it to Y by contradiction. So, using an analogous argument we have:\n\nargument we have:\n\nProposition 5.3. Let Y = { F = y 1 f s +⋯+ y s f s = 0 } ⊂ P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X be the quasi-smooth hypersurface associated to a quasi-smooth intersection subvariety X = X f 1 ∩ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ∩ X f s ⊂ P d Σ such that d + s = 2 ( k + 1 ) . If the Hodge conjecture holds on X then it holds as well on Y .\n\nCorollary 5.4. If the dimension of Y is 2 s − 1 , 2 s or 2 s + 1 then the Hodge conjecture holds on Y .\n\nProof.

## Using PyPDFium2


```python
from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFium2Loader
```


```python
loader = PyPDFium2Loader("example_data/layout-parser-paper.pdf")
```


```python
data = loader.load()
```

## Using PDFMiner


```python
from langchain.document_loaders import PDFMinerLoader
```


```python
loader = PDFMinerLoader("example_data/layout-parser-paper.pdf")
```


```python
data = loader.load()
```

### Using PDFMiner to generate HTML text

This can be helpful for chunking texts semantically into sections as the output html content can be parsed via `BeautifulSoup` to get more structured and rich information about font size, page numbers, pdf headers/footers, etc.


```python
from langchain.document_loaders import PDFMinerPDFasHTMLLoader
```


```python
loader = PDFMinerPDFasHTMLLoader("example_data/layout-parser-paper.pdf")
```


```python
data = loader.load()[0]   # entire pdf is loaded as a single Document
```


```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
soup = BeautifulSoup(data.page_content,'html.parser')
content = soup.find_all('div')
```


```python
import re
cur_fs = None
cur_text = ''
snippets = []   # first collect all snippets that have the same font size
for c in content:
    sp = c.find('span')
    if not sp:
        continue
    st = sp.get('style')
    if not st:
        continue
    fs = re.findall('font-size:(\d+)px',st)
    if not fs:
        continue
    fs = int(fs[0])
    if not cur_fs:
        cur_fs = fs
    if fs == cur_fs:
        cur_text += c.text
    else:
        snippets.append((cur_text,cur_fs))
        cur_fs = fs
        cur_text = c.text
snippets.append((cur_text,cur_fs))
# Note: The above logic is very straightforward. One can also add more strategies such as removing duplicate snippets (as
# headers/footers in a PDF appear on multiple pages so if we find duplicatess safe to assume that it is redundant info)
```


```python
from langchain.docstore.document import Document
cur_idx = -1
semantic_snippets = []
# Assumption: headings have higher font size than their respective content
for s in snippets:
    # if current snippet's font size > previous section's heading => it is a new heading
    if not semantic_snippets or s[1] > semantic_snippets[cur_idx].metadata['heading_font']:
        metadata={'heading':s[0], 'content_font': 0, 'heading_font': s[1]}
        metadata.update(data.metadata)
        semantic_snippets.append(Document(page_content='',metadata=metadata))
        cur_idx += 1
        continue
    
    # if current snippet's font size <= previous section's content => content belongs to the same section (one can also create
    # a tree like structure for sub sections if needed but that may require some more thinking and may be data specific)
    if not semantic_snippets[cur_idx].metadata['content_font'] or s[1] <= semantic_snippets[cur_idx].metadata['content_font']:
        semantic_snippets[cur_idx].page_content += s[0]
        semantic_snippets[cur_idx].metadata['content_font'] = max(s[1], semantic_snippets[cur_idx].metadata['content_font'])
        continue
    
    # if current snippet's font size > previous section's content but less than previous section's heading than also make a new

    Document(page_content='Recently, various DL models and datasets have been developed for layout analysis\ntasks. The dhSegment [22] utilizes fully convolutional networks [20] for segmen-\ntation tasks on historical documents. Object detection-based methods like Faster\nR-CNN [28] and Mask R-CNN [12] are used for identifying document elements [38]\nand detecting tables [30, 26]. Most recently, Graph Neural Networks [29] have also\nbeen used in table detection [27]. However, these models are usually implemented\nindividually and there is no uniﬁed framework to load and use such models.\nThere has been a surge of interest in creating open-source tools for document\nimage processing: a search of document image analysis in Github leads to 5M\nrelevant code pieces 6; yet most of them rely on traditional rule-based methods\nor provide limited functionalities. The closest prior research to our work is the\nOCR-D project7, which also tries to build a complete toolkit for DIA. However,\nsimilar to the platform developed by Neudecker et al. [21], it is designed for\nanalyzing historical documents, and provides no supports for recent DL models.\nThe DocumentLayoutAnalysis project8 focuses on processing born-digital PDF\ndocuments via analyzing the stored PDF data. Repositories like DeepLayout9\nand Detectron2-PubLayNet10 are individual deep learning models trained on\nlayout analysis datasets without support for the full DIA pipeline. The Document\nAnalysis and Exploitation (DAE) platform [15] and the DeepDIVA project [2]\naim to improve the reproducibility of DIA methods (or DL models), yet they\nare not actively maintained. OCR engines like Tesseract [14], easyOCR11 and\npaddleOCR12 usually do not come with comprehensive functionalities for other\nDIA tasks like layout analysis.\nRecent years have also seen numerous eﬀorts to create libraries for promoting\nreproducibility and reusability in the ﬁeld of DL. Libraries like Dectectron2 [35],\n6 The number shown is obtained by specifying the search type as ‘code’.\n7 https://ocr-d.de/en/about\n8 https://github.com/BobLd/DocumentLayoutAnalysis\n9 https://github.com/leonlulu/DeepLayout\n10 https://github.com/hpanwar08/detectron2\n11 https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR\n12 https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR\n4\nZ. Shen et al.\nFig. 1: The overall architecture of LayoutParser. For an input document image,\nthe core LayoutParser library provides a set of oﬀ-the-shelf tools for layout\ndetection, OCR, visualization, and storage, backed by a carefully designed layout\ndata structure. LayoutParser also supports high level customization via eﬃcient\nlayout annotation and model training functions. These improve model accuracy\non the target samples. The community platform enables the easy sharing of DIA\nmodels and whole digitization pipelines to promote reusability and reproducibility.\nA collection of detailed documentation, tutorials and exemplar projects make\nLayoutParser easy to learn and use.\nAllenNLP [8] and transformers [34] have provided the community with complete\nDL-based support for developing and deploying models for general computer\nvision and natural language processing problems. LayoutParser, on the other\nhand, specializes speciﬁcally in DIA tasks. LayoutParser is also equipped with a\ncommunity platform inspired by established model hubs such as Torch Hub [23]\nand TensorFlow Hub [1]. It enables the sharing of pretrained models as well as\nfull document processing pipelines that are unique to DIA tasks.\nThere have been a variety of document data collections to facilitate the\ndevelopment of DL models. Some examples include PRImA [3](magazine layouts),\nPubLayNet [38](academic paper layouts), Table Bank [18](tables in academic\npapers), Newspaper Navigator Dataset [16, 17](newspaper ﬁgure layouts) and\nHJDataset [31](historical Japanese document layouts). A spectrum of models\ntrained on these datasets are currently available in the LayoutParser model zoo\nto support diﬀerent use cases.\n', metadata={'heading': '2 Related Work\n', 'content_font': 9, 'heading_font': 11, 'source': 'example_data/layout-parser-paper.pdf'})

## Using PyMuPDF

This is the fastest of the PDF parsing options, and contains detailed metadata about the PDF and its pages, as well as returns one document per page.


```python
from langchain.document_loaders import PyMuPDFLoader
```


```python
loader = PyMuPDFLoader("example_data/layout-parser-paper.pdf")
```


```python
data = loader.load()
```

Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been\nprimarily driven by the application of neural networks.
