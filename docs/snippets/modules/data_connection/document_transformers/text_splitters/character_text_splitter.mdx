Here's an example of passing metadata along with the documents, notice that it is split along with the documents.


```python
metadatas = [{"document": 1}, {"document": 2}]
documents = text_splitter.create_documents([state_of_the_union, state_of_the_union], metadatas=metadatas)
print(documents[0])
```
