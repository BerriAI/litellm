```python
class BaseExampleSelector(ABC):
    """Interface for selecting examples to include in prompts."""

    @abstractmethod
    def select_examples(self, input_variables: Dict[str, str]) -> List[dict]:
        """Select which examples to use based on the inputs."""
```

The only method it needs to expose is a ``select_examples`` method. This takes in the input variables and then returns a list of examples. It is up to each specific implementation as to how those examples are selected. Let's take a look at some below.
