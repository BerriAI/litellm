    Verse 1:
    Bubbles rising to the top
    A refreshing drink that never stops
    Clear and crisp, it's pure delight
    A taste that's sure to excite
    
    Chorus:
    Sparkling water, oh so fine
    A drink that's always on my mind
    With every sip, I feel alive
    Sparkling water, you're my vibe
    
    Verse 2:
    No sugar, no calories, just pure bliss
    A drink that's hard to resist
    It's the perfect way to quench my thirst
    A drink that always comes first
    
    Chorus:
    Sparkling water, oh so fine
    A drink that's always on my mind
    With every sip, I feel alive
    Sparkling water, you're my vibe

    To a healthy life, a happy soul
    A drink that makes me feel whole

    Sparkling water, oh so fine
    A drink that's always on my mind

    Sparkling water, you're the one
