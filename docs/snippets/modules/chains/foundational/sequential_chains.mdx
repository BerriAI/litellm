## Sequential Chain
Of course, not all sequential chains will be as simple as passing a single string as an argument and getting a single string as output for all steps in the chain. In this next example, we will experiment with more complex chains that involve multiple inputs, and where there also multiple final outputs. 

Of particular importance is how we name the input/output variable names. In the above example we didn't have to think about that because we were just passing the output of one chain directly as input to the next, but here we do have worry about that because we have multiple inputs.


```python
# This is an LLMChain to write a synopsis given a title of a play and the era it is set in.
llm = OpenAI(temperature=.7)
template = """You are a playwright. Given the title of play and the era it is set in, it is your job to write a synopsis for that title.

Title: {title}
Era: {era}
Playwright: This is a synopsis for the above play:"""
prompt_template = PromptTemplate(input_variables=["title", "era"], template=template)
synopsis_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt_template, output_key="synopsis")
```


```python
# This is an LLMChain to write a review of a play given a synopsis.
llm = OpenAI(temperature=.7)
template = """You are a play critic from the New York Times. Given the synopsis of play, it is your job to write a review for that play.

Play Synopsis:
{synopsis}

prompt_template = PromptTemplate(input_variables=["synopsis"], template=template)
review_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt_template, output_key="review")
```


```python
# This is the overall chain where we run these two chains in sequence.
from langchain.chains import SequentialChain
overall_chain = SequentialChain(
    chains=[synopsis_chain, review_chain],
    input_variables=["era", "title"],
    # Here we return multiple variables
    output_variables=["synopsis", "review"],
    verbose=True)
```


```python
overall_chain({"title":"Tragedy at sunset on the beach", "era": "Victorian England"})

### Memory in Sequential Chains
Sometimes you may want to pass along some context to use in each step of the chain or in a later part of the chain, but maintaining and chaining together the input/output variables can quickly get messy.  Using `SimpleMemory` is a convenient way to do manage this and clean up your chains.

For example, using the previous playwright SequentialChain, lets say you wanted to include some context about date, time and location of the play, and using the generated synopsis and review, create some social media post text.  You could add these new context variables as `input_variables`, or we can add a `SimpleMemory` to the chain to manage this context:




```python
from langchain.chains import SequentialChain
from langchain.memory import SimpleMemory

llm = OpenAI(temperature=.7)
template = """You are a social media manager for a theater company.  Given the title of play, the era it is set in, the date,time and location, the synopsis of the play, and the review of the play, it is your job to write a social media post for that play.

Here is some context about the time and location of the play:
Date and Time: {time}
Location: {location}

Play Synopsis:
{synopsis}
Review from a New York Times play critic of the above play:
{review}

Social Media Post:
"""
prompt_template = PromptTemplate(input_variables=["synopsis", "review", "time", "location"], template=template)
social_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt_template, output_key="social_post_text")

overall_chain = SequentialChain(
    memory=SimpleMemory(memories={"time": "December 25th, 8pm PST", "location": "Theater in the Park"}),
    chains=[synopsis_chain, review_chain, social_chain],
    input_variables=["era", "title"],
    # Here we return multiple variables
    output_variables=["social_post_text"],
    verbose=True)

overall_chain({"title":"Tragedy at sunset on the beach", "era": "Victorian England"})
```
