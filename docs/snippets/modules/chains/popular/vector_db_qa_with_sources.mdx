## Return Source Documents
Additionally, we can return the source documents used to answer the question by specifying an optional parameter when constructing the chain.


```python
qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=OpenAI(), chain_type="stuff", retriever=docsearch.as_retriever(), return_source_documents=True)
```


```python
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
result = qa({"query": query})
```


```python
result["result"]
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    " The president said that Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of the nation's top legal minds, a former top litigator in private practice and a former federal public defender from a family of public school educators and police officers, and that she has received a broad range of support from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans."

Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. \n\nOne of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. \n\nAnd I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson.

I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year.

Alternatively, if our document have a "source" metadata key, we can use the `RetrievalQAWithSourceChain` to cite our sources:

```python
docsearch = Chroma.from_texts(texts, embeddings, metadatas=[{"source": f"{i}-pl"} for i in range(len(texts))])
```

```python
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain
from langchain import OpenAI

chain = RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain.from_chain_type(OpenAI(temperature=0), chain_type="stuff", retriever=docsearch.as_retriever())
```

```python
chain({"question": "What did the president say about Justice Breyer"}, return_only_outputs=True)

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">
