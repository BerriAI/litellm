    The problem we try to address with this class is to cache the lines of a transformed file,
    without knowing beforehand what type of transformation that file needs to undergo.

    When we scan the file, we iterate through the transformed lines, in hopes of finding a
    secret. If we do find something, we can break out of that iterator, and move on to the next
    file.

    However, when we audit the file, we *know* that we've found a secret in this location before
    -- we just don't know what type of transformation the file had underwent to get there. As
    such, we need to try all transformations until we find the secret that the scan told us about.
    Once we find it, we should cache the results of that transformation so other audits of the
    same file will be smoother.

    We do this through a self-invalidating cache (self.lines), when we change the mode to using
    eager transformers.
