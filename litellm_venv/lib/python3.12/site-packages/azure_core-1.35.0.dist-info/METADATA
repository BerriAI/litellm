# Azure Core shared client library for Python

Azure core provides shared exceptions and modules for Python SDK client libraries.
These libraries follow the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Python](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/python/guidelines/index.html) .

If you are a client library developer, please reference [client library developer reference](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/CLIENT_LIBRARY_DEVELOPER.md) for more information.

[Source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/)
| [Package (Pypi)][package]
| [Package (Conda)](https://anaconda.org/microsoft/azure-core/)
| [API reference documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/core-readme)

## Getting started

Typically, you will not need to install azure core;
it will be installed when you install one of the client libraries using it.
In case you want to install it explicitly (to implement your own client library, for example),
you can find it [here](https://pypi.org/project/azure-core/).

## Key concepts

### Azure Core Library Exceptions

#### AzureError

AzureError is the base exception for all errors.

```python
class AzureError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message, *args, **kwargs):
        self.inner_exception = kwargs.get("error")
        self.exc_type, self.exc_value, self.exc_traceback = sys.exc_info()
        self.exc_type = self.exc_type.__name__ if self.exc_type else type(self.inner_exception)
        self.exc_msg = "{}, {}: {}".format(message, self.exc_type, self.exc_value)  # type: ignore
        self.message = str(message)
        self.continuation_token = kwargs.get("continuation_token")
        super(AzureError, self).__init__(self.message, *args)
```

*message* is any message (str) to be associated with the exception.

*args* are any additional args to be included with exception.

*kwargs* are keyword arguments to include with the exception. Use the keyword *error* to pass in an internal exception and *continuation_token* for a token reference to continue an incomplete operation.

**The following exceptions inherit from AzureError:**

#### ServiceRequestError

An error occurred while attempt to make a request to the service. No request was sent.

#### ServiceResponseError

The request was sent, but the client failed to understand the response.
The connection may have timed out. These errors can be retried for idempotent or safe operations.

#### HttpResponseError

A request was made, and a non-success status code was received from the service.

```python
class HttpResponseError(AzureError):
    def __init__(self, message=None, response=None, **kwargs):
        self.reason = None
        self.response = response
        if response:
            self.reason = response.reason
            self.status_code = response.status_code
        self.error = self._parse_odata_body(ODataV4Format, response)  # type: Optional[ODataV4Format]
        if self.error:
            message = str(self.error)
        else:
            message = message or "Operation returned an invalid status '{}'".format(
                self.reason
            )

        super(HttpResponseError, self).__init__(message=message, **kwargs)
```

*message* is the HTTP response error message (optional)

*response* is the HTTP response (optional).

*kwargs* are keyword arguments to include with the exception.

**The following exceptions inherit from HttpResponseError:**

#### DecodeError

An error raised during response de-serialization.

#### IncompleteReadError

An error raised if peer closes the connection before we have received the complete message body.

#### ResourceExistsError

An error response with status code 4xx. This will not be raised directly by the Azure core pipeline.

#### ResourceNotFoundError

An error response, typically triggered by a 412 response (for update) or 404 (for get/post).

#### ResourceModifiedError

An error response with status code 4xx, typically 412 Conflict. This will not be raised directly by the Azure core pipeline.

#### ResourceNotModifiedError

An error response with status code 304. This will not be raised directly by the Azure core pipeline.

#### ClientAuthenticationError

An error response with status code 4xx. This will not be raised directly by the Azure core pipeline.

#### TooManyRedirectsError

An error raised when the maximum number of redirect attempts is reached. The maximum amount of redirects can be configured in the RedirectPolicy.

```python
class TooManyRedirectsError(HttpResponseError):
    def __init__(self, history, *args, **kwargs):
        self.history = history
        message = "Reached maximum redirect attempts."
        super(TooManyRedirectsError, self).__init__(message, *args, **kwargs)
```

*history* is used to document the requests/responses that resulted in redirected requests.

*args* are any additional args to be included with exception.

*kwargs* are keyword arguments to include with the exception.

#### StreamConsumedError

An error thrown if you try to access the stream of `azure.core.rest.HttpResponse` or `azure.core.rest.AsyncHttpResponse` once
the response stream has been consumed.

#### StreamClosedError

An error thrown if you try to access the stream of the `azure.core.rest.HttpResponse` or `azure.core.rest.AsyncHttpResponse` once
the response stream has been closed.

#### ResponseNotReadError

An error thrown if you try to access the `content` of `azure.core.rest.HttpResponse` or `azure.core.rest.AsyncHttpResponse` before
reading in the response's bytes first.

### Configurations

When calling the methods, some properties can be configured by passing in as kwargs arguments.

| Parameters | Description |
| --- | --- |
| headers | The HTTP Request headers. |
| request_id | The request id to be added into header. |
| user_agent | If specified, this will be added in front of the user agent string. |
| logging_enable| Use to enable per operation. Defaults to `False`. |
| logger | If specified, it will be used to log information. |
| response_encoding | The encoding to use if known for this service (will disable auto-detection). |
| raw_request_hook | Callback function. Will be invoked on request. |
| raw_response_hook | Callback function. Will be invoked on response. |
| network_span_namer | A callable to customize the span name. |
| tracing_attributes | Attributes to set on all created spans. |
| permit_redirects | Whether the client allows redirects. Defaults to `True`. |
| redirect_max | The maximum allowed redirects. Defaults to `30`. |
| retry_total | Total number of retries to allow. Takes precedence over other counts. Default value is `10`. |
| retry_connect | How many connection-related errors to retry on. These are errors raised before the request is sent to the remote server, which we assume has not triggered the server to process the request. Default value is `3`. |
| retry_read | How many times to retry on read errors. These errors are raised after the request was sent to the server, so the request may have side-effects. Default value is `3`. |
| retry_status | How many times to retry on bad status codes. Default value is `3`. |
| retry_backoff_factor | A backoff factor to apply between attempts after the second try (most errors are resolved immediately by a second try without a delay). Retry policy will sleep for: `{backoff factor} * (2 ** ({number of total retries} - 1))` seconds. If the backoff_factor is 0.1, then the retry will sleep for [0.0s, 0.2s, 0.4s, ...] between retries. The default value is `0.8`. |
| retry_backoff_max | The maximum back off time. Default value is `120` seconds (2 minutes). |
| retry_mode | Fixed or exponential delay between attempts, default is `Exponential`. |
| timeout | Timeout setting for the operation in seconds, default is `604800`s (7 days). |
| connection_timeout | A single float in seconds for the connection timeout. Defaults to `300` seconds. |
| read_timeout | A single float in seconds for the read timeout. Defaults to `300` seconds. |
| connection_verify | SSL certificate verification. Enabled by default. Set to False to disable, alternatively can be set to the path to a CA_BUNDLE file or directory with certificates of trusted CAs. |
| connection_cert | Client-side certificates. You can specify a local cert to use as client side certificate, as a single file (containing the private key and the certificate) or as a tuple of both files' paths. |
| proxies | Dictionary mapping protocol or protocol and hostname to the URL of the proxy. |
| cookies | Dict or CookieJar object to send with the `Request`. |
| connection_data_block_size | The block size of data sent over the connection. Defaults to `4096` bytes. |

### Async transport

The async transport is designed to be opt-in. [AioHttp](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/) is one of the supported implementations of async transport. It is not installed by default. You need to install it separately.

### Shared modules

#### MatchConditions

MatchConditions is an enum to describe match conditions.

```python
class MatchConditions(Enum):
    Unconditionally = 1  # Matches any condition
    IfNotModified = 2  # If the target object is not modified. Usually it maps to etag=<specific etag>
    IfModified = 3  # Only if the target object is modified. Usually it maps to etag!=<specific etag>
    IfPresent = 4   # If the target object exists. Usually it maps to etag='*'
    IfMissing = 5   # If the target object does not exist. Usually it maps to etag!='*'
```

#### CaseInsensitiveEnumMeta

A metaclass to support case-insensitive enums.

```python
from enum import Enum

from azure.core import CaseInsensitiveEnumMeta

class MyCustomEnum(str, Enum, metaclass=CaseInsensitiveEnumMeta):
    FOO = 'foo'
    BAR = 'bar'
```

#### Null Sentinel Value

A falsy sentinel object which is supposed to be used to specify attributes
with no data. This gets serialized to `null` on the wire.

```python
from azure.core.serialization import NULL

assert bool(NULL) is False

foo = Foo(
    attr=NULL
)
```

# Release History

## 1.35.0 (2025-07-02)

### Features Added

- Added a `start_time` keyword argument to the `start_span` and `start_as_current_span` methods in the `OpenTelemetryTracer` class. This allows users to specify a custom start time for created spans. #41106
- Added a `context` keyword argument to the `start_span` and `start_as_current_span` methods in the `OpenTelemetryTracer` class. This allows users to specify a custom parent context for created spans. #41511
- Added method `as_attribute_dict` to `azure.core.serialization` for backcompat migration purposes. Will return a generated model as a dictionary where the keys are in attribute syntax.
- Added `is_generated_model` method to `azure.core.serialization`. Returns whether a given input is a model from one of our generated sdks. #41445
- Added `attribute_list` method to `azure.core.serialization`. Returns all of the attributes of a given model from one of our generated sdks. #41571

### Other Changes

- A timeout error when using the `aiohttp` transport (the default for async SDKs) will now be raised as a `azure.core.exceptions.ServiceResponseTimeoutError`, a subtype of the previously raised `ServiceResponseError`.
- When using with `aiohttp` 3.10 or later, a connection timeout error will now be raised as a `azure.core.exceptions.ServiceRequestTimeoutError`, which can be retried.
- The default implementation of `on_challenge` in `BearerTokenCredentialPolicy` and `AsyncBearerTokenCredentialPolicy` will now cache the retrieved token. #41857

## 1.34.0 (2025-05-01)

### Features Added

- Added a `set_span_error_status` method to the `OpenTelemetryTracer` class. This method allows users to set the status of a span to `ERROR` after it has been created. #40703

### Other Changes

- Python 3.8 is no longer supported. Please use Python version 3.9 or later.

## 1.33.0 (2025-04-03)

### Features Added

- Added native OpenTelemetry tracing to Azure Core which enables users to use OpenTelemetry to trace Azure SDK operations without needing to install a plugin. #39563
    - To enable native OpenTelemetry tracing, users need to:
        1. Have `opentelemetry-api` installed.
        2. Ensure that `settings.tracing_implementation` is not set.
        3. Ensure that `settings.tracing_enabled` is set to `True`.
    - If `setting.tracing_implementation` is set, the tracing plugin will be used instead of the native tracing.
    - If `settings.tracing_enabled` is set to `False`, tracing will be disabled.
    - The `OpenTelemetryTracer` class was added to the `azure.core.tracing.opentelemetry` module. This is a wrapper around the OpenTelemetry tracer that is used to create spans for Azure SDK operations.
    - Added a `get_tracer` method to the new `azure.core.instrumentation` module. This method returns an instance of the `OpenTelemetryTracer` class if OpenTelemetry is available.
    - A `TracingOptions` TypedDict class was added to define the options that SDK users can use to configure tracing per-operation. These options include the ability to enable or disable tracing and set additional attributes on spans.
        - Example usage: `client.method(tracing_options={"enabled": True, "attributes": {"foo": "bar"}})`
    - The `DistributedTracingPolicy` and `distributed_trace`/`distributed_trace_async` decorators now uses the OpenTelemetry tracer if it is available and native tracing is enabled.
        - SDK clients can define an `_instrumentation_config` class variable to configure the OpenTelemetry tracer used in method span creation. Possible configuration options are `library_name`, `library_version`, `schema_url`, and `attributes`.
        - `DistributedTracingPolicy` now accepts a `instrumentation_config` keyword argument to configure the OpenTelemetry tracer used in HTTP span creation.

### Breaking Changes

- Removed automatic tracing enablement for the OpenTelemetry plugin if `opentelemetry` was imported. To enable tracing with the plugin, please import `azure.core.settings.settings` and set `settings.tracing_implementation` to `"opentelemetry"`. #39563
- In `DistributedTracingPolicy`, the default span name is now just the HTTP method (e.g., "GET", "POST") and no longer includes the URL path. This change was made to converge with the OpenTelemetry HTTP semantic conventions. The full URL is still included in the span attributes.
- Renamed span attributes in `DistributedTracingPolicy`:
    - "x-ms-client-request-id" is now "az.client_request_id"
    - "x-ms-request-id" is now "az.service_request_id"

### Bugs Fixed

- Fixed an issue where the `traceparent` header was not being set correctly in the `DistributedTracingPolicy`. The `traceparent` header will now set based on the context of the HTTP client span. #40074

### Other Changes

- Added `opentelemetry-api` as an optional dependency for tracing. This can be installed with `pip install azure-core[tracing]`. #39563

## 1.32.0 (2024-10-31)

### Features Added

- Added a default implementation to handle token challenges in `BearerTokenCredentialPolicy` and `AsyncBearerTokenCredentialPolicy`.

### Bugs Fixed

- Fixed an issue where the `tracing_attributes` keyword argument wasn't being handled at the request/method level. #38164

### Other Changes

- Log "x-vss-e2eid" and "x-msedge-ref" headers in `HttpLoggingPolicy`.

## 1.31.0 (2024-09-12)

### Features Added

- Added azure.core.AzureClouds enum to represent the different Azure clouds.
- Added two new credential protocol classes, `SupportsTokenInfo` and `AsyncSupportsTokenInfo`, to offer more extensibility in supporting various token acquisition scenarios. #36565
  - Each new protocol class defines a `get_token_info` method that returns an `AccessTokenInfo` object.
- Added a new `TokenRequestOptions` class, which is a `TypedDict` with optional parameters, that can be used to define options for token requests through the `get_token_info` method. #36565
- Added a new `AccessTokenInfo` class, which is returned by `get_token_info` implementations. This class contains the token, its expiration time, and optional additional information like when a token should be refreshed. #36565
- `BearerTokenCredentialPolicy` and `AsyncBearerTokenCredentialPolicy` now first check if a credential has the `get_token_info` method defined. If so, the `get_token_info` method is used to acquire a token. Otherwise, the `get_token` method is used. #36565
  - These policies now also check the `refresh_on` attribute when determining if a new token request should be made.

### Other Changes

- The Azure Core OpenTelemetry tracing plugin will now be the preferred tracing plugin over the OpenCensus plugin. If both plugins are installed and `opentelemetry` is imported, then OpenTelemetry will be used to trace Azure SDK operations.  #35050

## 1.30.2 (2024-06-06)

### Features Added

- Tracing: `DistributedTracingPolicy` will now set an attribute, `http.request.resend_count`, on HTTP spans for resent requests to indicate the resend attempt number.  #35069

### Bugs Fixed

- Raise correct exception if transport is used while already closed  #35559

### Other Changes

- HTTP tracing spans will now include an `error.type` attribute if an error status code is returned.  #34619
- Minimum required Python version is now 3.8

## 1.30.1 (2024-02-29)

### Other Changes

- Accept float for `retry_after` header.  #34203

- GA errors `StreamConsumedError`, `StreamClosedError`, and `ResponseNotReadError` to `azure.core.exceptions`. These errors
are thrown if you mishandle streamed responses from the `azure.core.rest` module
- add kwargs to the methods for `iter_raw` and `iter_bytes`  #21529
- no longer raise JSON errors if users pass in file descriptors of JSON to the `json` kwarg in `HttpRequest`  #21504
- Added new error type `IncompleteReadError` which is raised if peer closes the connection before we have received the complete message body.

### Breaking Changes

- SansIOHTTPPolicy.on_exception returns None instead of bool.

### Bugs Fixed

- The `Content-Length` header in a http response is strictly checked against the actual number of bytes in the body,
  rather than silently truncating data in case the underlying tcp connection is closed prematurely.
  (thanks to @jochen-ott-by for the contribution)   #20412
- UnboundLocalError when SansIOHTTPPolicy handles an exception    #15222
- Add default content type header of `text/plain` and content length header for users who pass unicode strings to the `content` kwarg of `HttpRequest` in 2.7  #21550

### Other Changes

- Refactor AzureJSONEncoder (thanks to @Codejune for the contribution)  #21028

## 1.19.0 (2021-09-30)

### Breaking Changes in the Provisional `azure.core.rest` package

- `azure.core.rest.HttpResponse` and `azure.core.rest.AsyncHttpResponse` are now abstract base classes. They should not be initialized directly, instead
your transport responses should inherit from them and implement them.
- The properties of the `azure.core.rest` responses are now all read-only

- HttpLoggingPolicy integrates logs into one record #19925

## 1.18.0 (2021-09-02)

### Features Added

- `azure.core.serialization.AzureJSONEncoder` (introduced in 1.17.0) serializes `datetime.datetime` objects in ISO 8601 format, conforming to RFC 3339's specification.    #20190
- We now use `azure.core.serialization.AzureJSONEncoder` to serialize `json` input to `azure.core.rest.HttpRequest`.

### Breaking Changes in the Provisional `azure.core.rest` package

- The `text` property on `azure.core.rest.HttpResponse` and `azure.core.rest.AsyncHttpResponse` has changed to a method, which also takes
an `encoding` parameter.
- Removed `iter_text` and `iter_lines` from `azure.core.rest.HttpResponse` and `azure.core.rest.AsyncHttpResponse`

### Bugs Fixed

- The behaviour of the headers returned in `azure.core.rest` responses now aligns across sync and async. Items can now be checked case-insensitively and without raising an error for format.

## 1.17.0 (2021-08-05)

### Features Added

- Cut hard dependency on requests library
- Added a `from_json` method which now accepts storage QueueMessage, eventhub's EventData or ServiceBusMessage or simply json bytes to return a `CloudEvent`

### Fixed

- Not override "x-ms-client-request-id" if it already exists in the header.    #17757

### Breaking Changes in the Provisional `azure.core.rest` package

- `azure.core.rest` will not try to guess the `charset` anymore if it was impossible to extract it from `HttpResponse` analysis. This removes our dependency on `charset`.

## 1.16.0 (2021-07-01)

### Features Added

- Add new ***provisional*** methods `send_request` onto the `azure.core.PipelineClient` and `azure.core.AsyncPipelineClient`. This method takes in
requests and sends them through our pipelines.
- Add new ***provisional*** module `azure.core.rest`. `azure.core.rest` is our new public simple HTTP library in `azure.core` that users will use to create requests, and consume responses.
- Add new ***provisional*** errors `StreamConsumedError`, `StreamClosedError`, and `ResponseNotReadError` to `azure.core.exceptions`. These errors
are thrown if you mishandle streamed responses from the provisional `azure.core.rest` module

### Fixed

- Improved error message in the `from_dict` method of `CloudEvent` when a wrong schema is sent.

## 1.15.0 (2021-06-04)
