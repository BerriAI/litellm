# Official Sentry SDK for Python

[![Build Status](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![PyPi page link -- version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/sentry-sdk.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sentry-sdk)

Welcome to the official Python SDK for **[Sentry](http://sentry.io/)**!

## Getting Started

### Installation

Getting Sentry into your project is straightforward. Just run this command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk
```

### Basic Configuration

Here’s a quick configuration example to get Sentry up and running:

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    "https://12927b5f211046b575ee51fd8b1ac34f@o1.ingest.sentry.io/1",  # Your DSN here

    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)
```

With this configuration, Sentry will monitor for exceptions and performance issues.

### Quick Usage Example

To generate some events that will show up in Sentry, you can log messages or capture errors:

```python
from sentry_sdk import capture_message
capture_message("Hello Sentry!")  # You'll see this in your Sentry dashboard.

raise ValueError("Oops, something went wrong!")  # This will create an error event in Sentry.
```

#### Explore the Docs

For more details on advanced usage, integrations, and customization, check out the full documentation:

- [Official SDK Docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/)
- [API Reference](https://getsentry.github.io/sentry-python/)

## Integrations

Sentry integrates with many popular Python libraries and frameworks, including:

- [Django](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/integrations/django/)
- [Flask](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/integrations/flask/)
- [FastAPI](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/integrations/fastapi/)
- [Celery](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/integrations/celery/)
- [AWS Lambda](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/integrations/aws-lambda/)

Want more? [Check out the full list of integrations](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/integrations/).

### Rolling Your Own Integration?

If you want to create a new integration or improve an existing one, we’d welcome your contributions! Please read our [contributing guide](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before starting.

## Migrating Between Versions?

### From `1.x` to `2.x`

If you're using the older `1.x` version of the SDK, now's the time to upgrade to `2.x`. It includes significant upgrades and new features. Check our [migration guide](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/migration/1.x-to-2.x) for assistance.

### From `raven-python`

Using the legacy `raven-python` client? It's now in maintenance mode, and we recommend migrating to the new SDK for an improved experience. Get all the details in our [migration guide](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/migration/raven-to-sentry-sdk/).

## Want to Contribute?

We’d love your help in improving the Sentry SDK! Whether it’s fixing bugs, adding features, or enhancing documentation, every contribution is valuable.

For details on how to contribute, please check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and explore the [open issues](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/issues).
