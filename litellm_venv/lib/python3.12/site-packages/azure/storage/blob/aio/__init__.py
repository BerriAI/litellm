        The number of parallel connections with which to download.

        If true, calculates an MD5 hash for each chunk of the blob. The storage
        service checks the hash of the content that has arrived with the hash
        that was sent. This is primarily valuable for detecting bitflips on
        the wire if using http instead of https as https (the default) will
        already validate. Note that this MD5 hash is not stored with the
        blob. Also note that if enabled, the memory-efficient upload algorithm
        will not be used, because computing the MD5 hash requires buffering
        entire blocks, and doing so defeats the purpose of the memory-efficient algorithm.

        Encoding to use if text is supplied as input. Defaults to UTF-8.
