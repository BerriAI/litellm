    """Poller for deleting resources, and recovering deleted resources, in vaults with soft-delete enabled.

    This works by polling for the existence of the deleted or recovered resource. When a resource is deleted, Key Vault
    immediately removes it from its collection. However, the resource will not immediately appear in the deleted
    collection. Key Vault will therefore respond 404 to GET requests for the deleted resource; when it responds 2xx,
    the resource exists in the deleted collection i.e. its deletion is complete.

    Similarly, while recovering a deleted resource, Key Vault will respond 404 to GET requests for the non-deleted
    resource; when it responds 2xx, the resource exists in the non-deleted collection, i.e. its recovery is complete.
