        Args:
          max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens to generate before stopping.

              Note that our models may stop _before_ reaching this maximum. This parameter
              only specifies the absolute maximum number of tokens to generate.

              Different models have different maximum values for this parameter. See
              [models](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/models-overview) for details.

          messages: Input messages.

              Our models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant`
              conversational turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior
              conversational turns with the `messages` parameter, and the model then generates
              the next `Message` in the conversation. Consecutive `user` or `assistant` turns
              in your request will be combined into a single turn.

              Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can
              specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and
              `assistant` messages.

              If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will
              continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to
              constrain part of the model's response.

              Example with a single `user` message:

              ```json
              [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }]
              ```

              Example with multiple conversational turns:

              ```json
              [
                { "role": "user", "content": "Hello there." },
                { "role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?" },
                { "role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?" }
              ]
              ```

              Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:

              ```json
              [
                {
                  "role": "user",
                  "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"
                },
                { "role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is (" }
              ]
              ```

              Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of
              content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for
              `content` is shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The
              following input messages are equivalent:

              ```json
              { "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }
              ```

              ```json
              { "role": "user", "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Hello, Claude" }] }
              ```

              Starting with Claude 3 models, you can also send image content blocks:

              ```json
              {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                  {
                    "type": "image",
                    "source": {
                      "type": "base64",
                      "media_type": "image/jpeg",
                      "data": "/9j/4AAQSkZJRg..."
                    }
                  },
                  { "type": "text", "text": "What is in this image?" }
                ]
              }
              ```

              We currently support the `base64` source type for images, and the `image/jpeg`,
              `image/png`, `image/gif`, and `image/webp` media types.

              See [examples](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-examples#vision) for
              more input examples.

              Note that if you want to include a
              [system prompt](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/system-prompts), you can use
              the top-level `system` parameter — there is no `"system"` role for input
              messages in the Messages API.

              There is a limit of 100000 messages in a single request.

          model: The model that will complete your prompt.\n\nSee
              [models](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/models-overview) for additional
              details and options.

          metadata: An object describing metadata about the request.

          service_tier: Determines whether to use priority capacity (if available) or standard capacity
              for this request.

              Anthropic offers different levels of service for your API requests. See
              [service-tiers](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/service-tiers) for details.

          stop_sequences: Custom text sequences that will cause the model to stop generating.

              Our models will normally stop when they have naturally completed their turn,
              which will result in a response `stop_reason` of `"end_turn"`.

              If you want the model to stop generating when it encounters custom strings of
              text, you can use the `stop_sequences` parameter. If the model encounters one of
              the custom sequences, the response `stop_reason` value will be `"stop_sequence"`
              and the response `stop_sequence` value will contain the matched stop sequence.

          stream: Whether to incrementally stream the response using server-sent events.

              See [streaming](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-streaming) for
              details.

          system: System prompt.

              A system prompt is a way of providing context and instructions to Claude, such
              as specifying a particular goal or role. See our
              [guide to system prompts](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/system-prompts).

          temperature: Amount of randomness injected into the response.

              Defaults to `1.0`. Ranges from `0.0` to `1.0`. Use `temperature` closer to `0.0`
              for analytical / multiple choice, and closer to `1.0` for creative and
              generative tasks.

              Note that even with `temperature` of `0.0`, the results will not be fully
              deterministic.

          thinking: Configuration for enabling Claude's extended thinking.

              When enabled, responses include `thinking` content blocks showing Claude's
              thinking process before the final answer. Requires a minimum budget of 1,024
              tokens and counts towards your `max_tokens` limit.

              See
              [extended thinking](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking)
              for details.

          tool_choice: How the model should use the provided tools. The model can use a specific tool,
              any available tool, decide by itself, or not use tools at all.

          tools: Definitions of tools that the model may use.

              If you include `tools` in your API request, the model may return `tool_use`
              content blocks that represent the model's use of those tools. You can then run
              those tools using the tool input generated by the model and then optionally
              return results back to the model using `tool_result` content blocks.

              Each tool definition includes:

              - `name`: Name of the tool.
              - `description`: Optional, but strongly-recommended description of the tool.
              - `input_schema`: [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) for the
                tool `input` shape that the model will produce in `tool_use` output content
                blocks.

              For example, if you defined `tools` as:

              ```json
              [
                {
                  "name": "get_stock_price",
                  "description": "Get the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.",
                  "input_schema": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                      "ticker": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The stock ticker symbol, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc."
                      }
                    },
                    "required": ["ticker"]
                  }
                }
              ]
              ```

              And then asked the model "What's the S&P 500 at today?", the model might produce
              `tool_use` content blocks in the response like this:

              ```json
              [
                {
                  "type": "tool_use",
                  "id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
                  "name": "get_stock_price",
                  "input": { "ticker": "^GSPC" }
                }
              ]
              ```

              You might then run your `get_stock_price` tool with `{"ticker": "^GSPC"}` as an
              input, and return the following back to the model in a subsequent `user`
              message:

              ```json
              [
                {
                  "type": "tool_result",
                  "tool_use_id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
                  "content": "259.75 USD"
                }
              ]
              ```

              Tools can be used for workflows that include running client-side tools and
              functions, or more generally whenever you want the model to produce a particular
              JSON structure of output.

              See our [guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/tool-use) for more details.

          top_k: Only sample from the top K options for each subsequent token.

              Used to remove "long tail" low probability responses.
              [Learn more technical details here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-sample-from-language-models-682bceb97277).

              Recommended for advanced use cases only. You usually only need to use
              `temperature`.

          top_p: Use nucleus sampling.

              In nucleus sampling, we compute the cumulative distribution over all the options
              for each subsequent token in decreasing probability order and cut it off once it
              reaches a particular probability specified by `top_p`. You should either alter
              `temperature` or `top_p`, but not both.

              Recommended for advanced use cases only. You usually only need to use
              `temperature`.

                  "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"
                },
                { "role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is (" }
              ]
              ```

              Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of
              content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for
              `content` is shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The
              following input messages are equivalent:

              ```json
              { "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }
              ```

              ```json
              { "role": "user", "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Hello, Claude" }] }
              ```

              Starting with Claude 3 models, you can also send image content blocks:

              ```json
              {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                  {
                    "type": "image",
                    "source": {
                      "type": "base64",
                      "media_type": "image/jpeg",
                      "data": "/9j/4AAQSkZJRg..."
                    }
                  },
                  { "type": "text", "text": "What is in this image?" }
                ]
              }
              ```

              We currently support the `base64` source type for images, and the `image/jpeg`,
              `image/png`, `image/gif`, and `image/webp` media types.

              See [examples](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-examples#vision) for
              more input examples.

              Note that if you want to include a
              [system prompt](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/system-prompts), you can use
              the top-level `system` parameter — there is no `"system"` role for input
              messages in the Messages API.

              There is a limit of 100000 messages in a single request.

          model: The model that will complete your prompt.\n\nSee
              [models](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/models-overview) for additional
              details and options.

          stream: Whether to incrementally stream the response using server-sent events.

              See [streaming](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-streaming) for
              details.

          metadata: An object describing metadata about the request.

          service_tier: Determines whether to use priority capacity (if available) or standard capacity
              for this request.

              Anthropic offers different levels of service for your API requests. See
              [service-tiers](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/service-tiers) for details.

          stop_sequences: Custom text sequences that will cause the model to stop generating.

              Our models will normally stop when they have naturally completed their turn,
              which will result in a response `stop_reason` of `"end_turn"`.

              If you want the model to stop generating when it encounters custom strings of
              text, you can use the `stop_sequences` parameter. If the model encounters one of
              the custom sequences, the response `stop_reason` value will be `"stop_sequence"`
              and the response `stop_sequence` value will contain the matched stop sequence.

          system: System prompt.

              A system prompt is a way of providing context and instructions to Claude, such
              as specifying a particular goal or role. See our
              [guide to system prompts](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/system-prompts).

          temperature: Amount of randomness injected into the response.

              Defaults to `1.0`. Ranges from `0.0` to `1.0`. Use `temperature` closer to `0.0`
              for analytical / multiple choice, and closer to `1.0` for creative and
              generative tasks.

              Note that even with `temperature` of `0.0`, the results will not be fully
              deterministic.

          thinking: Configuration for enabling Claude's extended thinking.

              When enabled, responses include `thinking` content blocks showing Claude's
              thinking process before the final answer. Requires a minimum budget of 1,024
              tokens and counts towards your `max_tokens` limit.

              See
              [extended thinking](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking)
              for details.

          tool_choice: How the model should use the provided tools. The model can use a specific tool,
              any available tool, decide by itself, or not use tools at all.

          tools: Definitions of tools that the model may use.

              If you include `tools` in your API request, the model may return `tool_use`
              content blocks that represent the model's use of those tools. You can then run
              those tools using the tool input generated by the model and then optionally
              return results back to the model using `tool_result` content blocks.

              Each tool definition includes:

              - `name`: Name of the tool.
              - `description`: Optional, but strongly-recommended description of the tool.
              - `input_schema`: [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) for the
                tool `input` shape that the model will produce in `tool_use` output content
                blocks.

              For example, if you defined `tools` as:

              ```json
              [
                {
                  "name": "get_stock_price",
                  "description": "Get the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.",
                  "input_schema": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                      "ticker": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The stock ticker symbol, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc."
                      }
                    },
                    "required": ["ticker"]
                  }
                }
              ]
              ```

              And then asked the model "What's the S&P 500 at today?", the model might produce
              `tool_use` content blocks in the response like this:

              ```json
              [
                {
                  "type": "tool_use",
                  "id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
                  "name": "get_stock_price",
                  "input": { "ticker": "^GSPC" }
                }
              ]
              ```

              You might then run your `get_stock_price` tool with `{"ticker": "^GSPC"}` as an
              input, and return the following back to the model in a subsequent `user`
              message:

              ```json
              [
                {
                  "type": "tool_result",
                  "tool_use_id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
                  "content": "259.75 USD"
                }
              ]
              ```

              Tools can be used for workflows that include running client-side tools and
              functions, or more generally whenever you want the model to produce a particular
              JSON structure of output.

              See our [guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/tool-use) for more details.

          top_k: Only sample from the top K options for each subsequent token.

              Used to remove "long tail" low probability responses.
              [Learn more technical details here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-sample-from-language-models-682bceb97277).

              Recommended for advanced use cases only. You usually only need to use
              `temperature`.

          top_p: Use nucleus sampling.

              In nucleus sampling, we compute the cumulative distribution over all the options
              for each subsequent token in decreasing probability order and cut it off once it
              reaches a particular probability specified by `top_p`. You should either alter
              `temperature` or `top_p`, but not both.

              Recommended for advanced use cases only. You usually only need to use
              `temperature`.

        Args:
          max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens to generate before stopping.

              Note that our models may stop _before_ reaching this maximum. This parameter
              only specifies the absolute maximum number of tokens to generate.

              Different models have different maximum values for this parameter. See
              [models](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/models-overview) for details.

          messages: Input messages.

              Our models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant`
              conversational turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior
              conversational turns with the `messages` parameter, and the model then generates
              the next `Message` in the conversation. Consecutive `user` or `assistant` turns
              in your request will be combined into a single turn.

              Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can
              specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and
              `assistant` messages.

              If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will
              continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to
              constrain part of the model's response.

              Example with a single `user` message:

              ```json
              [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }]
              ```

              Example with multiple conversational turns:

              ```json
              [
                { "role": "user", "content": "Hello there." },
                { "role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?" },
                { "role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?" }
              ]
              ```

              Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:

              ```json
              [
                {
                  "role": "user",
                  "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"
                },
                { "role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is (" }
              ]
              ```

              Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of
              content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for
              `content` is shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The
              following input messages are equivalent:

              ```json
              { "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }
              ```

              ```json
              { "role": "user", "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Hello, Claude" }] }
              ```

              Starting with Claude 3 models, you can also send image content blocks:

              ```json
              {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [

                ]

                  "input_schema": {
                    "type": "object",

                      }

                    "required": ["ticker"]
                  }
                }
              ]
              ```

              And then asked the model "What's the S&P 500 at today?", the model might produce
              `tool_use` content blocks in the response like this:

              ```json
              [
                {
                  "type": "tool_use",
                  "id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
                  "name": "get_stock_price",
                  "input": { "ticker": "^GSPC" }
                }
              ]
              ```

              You might then run your `get_stock_price` tool with `{"ticker": "^GSPC"}` as an
              input, and return the following back to the model in a subsequent `user`
              message:

              ```json
              [
                {
                  "type": "tool_result",
                  "tool_use_id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
                  "content": "259.75 USD"
                }
              ]
              ```

              Tools can be used for workflows that include running client-side tools and
              functions, or more generally whenever you want the model to produce a particular
              JSON structure of output.

              See our [guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/tool-use) for more details.

          top_k: Only sample from the top K options for each subsequent token.

              Used to remove "long tail" low probability responses.
              [Learn more technical details here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-sample-from-language-models-682bceb97277).

              Recommended for advanced use cases only. You usually only need to use
              `temperature`.

          top_p: Use nucleus sampling.

              In nucleus sampling, we compute the cumulative distribution over all the options
              for each subsequent token in decreasing probability order and cut it off once it
              reaches a particular probability specified by `top_p`. You should either alter
              `temperature` or `top_p`, but not both.

              Recommended for advanced use cases only. You usually only need to use
              `temperature`.

        Count the number of tokens in a Message.

        The Token Count API can be used to count the number of tokens in a Message,

        [user guide](/en/docs/build-with-claude/token-counting)

          messages: Input messages.

              Our models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant`
              conversational turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior
              conversational turns with the `messages` parameter, and the model then generates
              the next `Message` in the conversation. Consecutive `user` or `assistant` turns
              in your request will be combined into a single turn.

              Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can
              specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and
              `assistant` messages.

              If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will
              continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to
              constrain part of the model's response.

              Example with a single `user` message:

              ```json
              [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }]
              ```

              Example with multiple conversational turns:

              ```json
              [
                { "role": "user", "content": "Hello there." },
                { "role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?" },
                { "role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?" }
              ]
              ```

              Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:

              ```json
              [
                {
                  "role": "user",
                  "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"
                },
                { "role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is (" }
              ]
              ```

              Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of
              content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for
              `content` is shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The
              following input messages are equivalent:

              ```json
              { "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }
              ```

              ```json
              { "role": "user", "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Hello, Claude" }] }
              ```

              Starting with Claude 3 models, you can also send image content blocks:

              ```json
              {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                  {
                    "type": "image",
                    "source": {
                      "type": "base64",
                      "media_type": "image/jpeg",
                      "data": "/9j/4AAQSkZJRg..."
                    }
                  },
                  { "type": "text", "text": "What is in this image?" }
                ]
              }
              ```

              We currently support the `base64` source type for images, and the `image/jpeg`,
              `image/png`, `image/gif`, and `image/webp` media types.

              See [examples](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-examples#vision) for
              more input examples.

              Note that if you want to include a
              [system prompt](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/system-prompts), you can use
              the top-level `system` parameter — there is no `"system"` role for input
              messages in the Messages API.

              There is a limit of 100000 messages in a single request.

          model: The model that will complete your prompt.\n\nSee
              [models](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/models-overview) for additional
              details and options.

          system: System prompt.

              A system prompt is a way of providing context and instructions to Claude, such
              as specifying a particular goal or role. See our
              [guide to system prompts](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/system-prompts).

          thinking: Configuration for enabling Claude's extended thinking.

              When enabled, responses include `thinking` content blocks showing Claude's
              thinking process before the final answer. Requires a minimum budget of 1,024
              tokens and counts towards your `max_tokens` limit.

              See
              [extended thinking](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking)
              for details.

          tool_choice: How the model should use the provided tools. The model can use a specific tool,
              any available tool, decide by itself, or not use tools at all.

          tools: Definitions of tools that the model may use.

              If you include `tools` in your API request, the model may return `tool_use`
              content blocks that represent the model's use of those tools. You can then run
              those tools using the tool input generated by the model and then optionally
              return results back to the model using `tool_result` content blocks.

              Each tool definition includes:

              - `name`: Name of the tool.
              - `description`: Optional, but strongly-recommended description of the tool.
              - `input_schema`: [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) for the
                tool `input` shape that the model will produce in `tool_use` output content
                blocks.

              For example, if you defined `tools` as:

              ```json
              [
                {
                  "name": "get_stock_price",
                  "description": "Get the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.",
                  "input_schema": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                      "ticker": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The stock ticker symbol, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc."
                      }
                    },
                    "required": ["ticker"]

                }
              ]
              ```

              And then asked the model "What's the S&P 500 at today?", the model might produce
              `tool_use` content blocks in the response like this:

              ```json
              [
                {
                  "type": "tool_use",

                  "input": { "ticker": "^GSPC" }
                }
              ]
              ```

              You might then run your `get_stock_price` tool with `{"ticker": "^GSPC"}` as an
              input, and return the following back to the model in a subsequent `user`
              message:

              ```json
              [
                {
                  "type": "tool_result",
                  "tool_use_id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
                  "content": "259.75 USD"
                }
              ]
              ```

              Tools can be used for workflows that include running client-side tools and
              functions, or more generally whenever you want the model to produce a particular
              JSON structure of output.

        Send a structured list of input messages with text and/or image content, and the

        The Messages API can be used for either single queries or stateless multi-turn
        conversations.

        Args:
          max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens to generate before stopping.

              Note that our models may stop _before_ reaching this maximum. This parameter
              only specifies the absolute maximum number of tokens to generate.

              Different models have different maximum values for this parameter. See
              [models](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/models-overview) for details.

          messages: Input messages.

              Our models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant`
              conversational turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior
              conversational turns with the `messages` parameter, and the model then generates
              the next `Message` in the conversation. Consecutive `user` or `assistant` turns
              in your request will be combined into a single turn.

              Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can
              specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and
              `assistant` messages.

              If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will
              continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to
              constrain part of the model's response.

              Example with a single `user` message:

              ```json
              [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }]
              ```

              Example with multiple conversational turns:

              ```json
              [
                { "role": "user", "content": "Hello there." },
                { "role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?" },
                { "role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?" }
              ]
              ```

              Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:

              ```json
              [
                {
                  "role": "user",
                  "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"
                },
                { "role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is (" }
              ]
              ```

              Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of
              content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for
              `content` is shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The
              following input messages are equivalent:

              ```json
              { "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }
              ```

              ```json
              { "role": "user", "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Hello, Claude" }] }
              ```

              Starting with Claude 3 models, you can also send image content blocks:

              ```json
              {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                  {
                    "type": "image",
                    "source": {
                      "type": "base64",
                      "media_type": "image/jpeg",
                      "data": "/9j/4AAQSkZJRg..."
                    }
                  },
                  { "type": "text", "text": "What is in this image?" }
                ]
              }
              ```

              We currently support the `base64` source type for images, and the `image/jpeg`,
              `image/png`, `image/gif`, and `image/webp` media types.

              See [examples](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-examples#vision) for
              more input examples.

              Note that if you want to include a
              [system prompt](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/system-prompts), you can use
              the top-level `system` parameter — there is no `"system"` role for input
              messages in the Messages API.

              There is a limit of 100000 messages in a single request.

          model: The model that will complete your prompt.\n\nSee
              [models](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/models-overview) for additional
              details and options.

          metadata: An object describing metadata about the request.

          service_tier: Determines whether to use priority capacity (if available) or standard capacity
              for this request.

              Anthropic offers different levels of service for your API requests. See
              [service-tiers](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/service-tiers) for details.

          stop_sequences: Custom text sequences that will cause the model to stop generating.

              Our models will normally stop when they have naturally completed their turn,
              which will result in a response `stop_reason` of `"end_turn"`.

              If you want the model to stop generating when it encounters custom strings of
              text, you can use the `stop_sequences` parameter. If the model encounters one of
              the custom sequences, the response `stop_reason` value will be `"stop_sequence"`
              and the response `stop_sequence` value will contain the matched stop sequence.

          stream: Whether to incrementally stream the response using server-sent events.

              See [streaming](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-streaming) for
              details.

          system: System prompt.

              A system prompt is a way of providing context and instructions to Claude, such
              as specifying a particular goal or role. See our
              [guide to system prompts](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/system-prompts).

          temperature: Amount of randomness injected into the response.

              Defaults to `1.0`. Ranges from `0.0` to `1.0`. Use `temperature` closer to `0.0`
              for analytical / multiple choice, and closer to `1.0` for creative and
              generative tasks.

              Note that even with `temperature` of `0.0`, the results will not be fully
              deterministic.

          thinking: Configuration for enabling Claude's extended thinking.

              When enabled, responses include `thinking` content blocks showing Claude's
              thinking process before the final answer. Requires a minimum budget of 1,024
              tokens and counts towards your `max_tokens` limit.

              See
              [extended thinking](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking)
              for details.

          tool_choice: How the model should use the provided tools. The model can use a specific tool,
              any available tool, decide by itself, or not use tools at all.

          tools: Definitions of tools that the model may use.

              If you include `tools` in your API request, the model may return `tool_use`
              content blocks that represent the model's use of those tools. You can then run
              those tools using the tool input generated by the model and then optionally
              return results back to the model using `tool_result` content blocks.

              Each tool definition includes:

              - `name`: Name of the tool.
              - `description`: Optional, but strongly-recommended description of the tool.
              - `input_schema`: [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) for the
                tool `input` shape that the model will produce in `tool_use` output content
                blocks.

              For example, if you defined `tools` as:

              ```json
              [
                {
                  "name": "get_stock_price",
                  "description": "Get the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.",
                  "input_schema": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                      "ticker": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The stock ticker symbol, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc."
                      }
                    },
                    "required": ["ticker"]
                  }
                }
              ]
              ```

              And then asked the model "What's the S&P 500 at today?", the model might produce
              `tool_use` content blocks in the response like this:

              ```json
              [
                {
                  "type": "tool_use",
                  "id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
                  "name": "get_stock_price",
                  "input": { "ticker": "^GSPC" }
                }
              ]
              ```

              You might then run your `get_stock_price` tool with `{"ticker": "^GSPC"}` as an
              input, and return the following back to the model in a subsequent `user`
              message:

              ```json
              [
                {
                  "type": "tool_result",
                  "tool_use_id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
                  "content": "259.75 USD"
                }
              ]
              ```

              Tools can be used for workflows that include running client-side tools and
              functions, or more generally whenever you want the model to produce a particular
              JSON structure of output.

              See our [guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/tool-use) for more details.

          top_k: Only sample from the top K options for each subsequent token.

              Used to remove "long tail" low probability responses.
              [Learn more technical details here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-sample-from-language-models-682bceb97277).

              Recommended for advanced use cases only. You usually only need to use
              `temperature`.

          top_p: Use nucleus sampling.

              In nucleus sampling, we compute the cumulative distribution over all the options
              for each subsequent token in decreasing probability order and cut it off once it
              reaches a particular probability specified by `top_p`. You should either alter
              `temperature` or `top_p`, but not both.

              Recommended for advanced use cases only. You usually only need to use
              `temperature`.

              in your request will be combined into a single turn.

              Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can
              specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and
              `assistant` messages.

              If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will
              continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to
              constrain part of the model's response.

              Example with a single `user` message:

              ```json
              [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }]
              ```

              Example with multiple conversational turns:

              ```json
              [
                { "role": "user", "content": "Hello there." },
                { "role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?" },
                { "role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?" }
              ]
              ```

              Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:

              ```json
              [
                {
                  "role": "user",
                  "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"
                },
                { "role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is (" }
              ]
              ```

              Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of
              content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for
              `content` is shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The
              following input messages are equivalent:

              ```json
              { "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }
              ```

              ```json
              { "role": "user", "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Hello, Claude" }] }
              ```

              Starting with Claude 3 models, you can also send image content blocks:

              ```json
              {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                  {
                    "type": "image",
                    "source": {
                      "type": "base64",
                      "media_type": "image/jpeg",
                      "data": "/9j/4AAQSkZJRg..."
                    }
                  },
                  { "type": "text", "text": "What is in this image?" }
                ]
              }
              ```

              We currently support the `base64` source type for images, and the `image/jpeg`,
              `image/png`, `image/gif`, and `image/webp` media types.

              See [examples](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-examples#vision) for
              more input examples.

              Note that if you want to include a
              [system prompt](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/system-prompts), you can use
              the top-level `system` parameter — there is no `"system"` role for input
              messages in the Messages API.

              There is a limit of 100000 messages in a single request.

          model: The model that will complete your prompt.\n\nSee
              [models](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/models-overview) for additional
              details and options.

          stream: Whether to incrementally stream the response using server-sent events.

              See [streaming](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-streaming) for
              details.

          metadata: An object describing metadata about the request.

          service_tier: Determines whether to use priority capacity (if available) or standard capacity
              for this request.

              Anthropic offers different levels of service for your API requests. See
              [service-tiers](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/service-tiers) for details.

          stop_sequences: Custom text sequences that will cause the model to stop generating.

              Our models will normally stop when they have naturally completed their turn,
              which will result in a response `stop_reason` of `"end_turn"`.

              If you want the model to stop generating when it encounters custom strings of
              text, you can use the `stop_sequences` parameter. If the model encounters one of
              the custom sequences, the response `stop_reason` value will be `"stop_sequence"`
              and the response `stop_sequence` value will contain the matched stop sequence.

          system: System prompt.

              A system prompt is a way of providing context and instructions to Claude, such
              as specifying a particular goal or role. See our
              [guide to system prompts](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/system-prompts).

          temperature: Amount of randomness injected into the response.

              Defaults to `1.0`. Ranges from `0.0` to `1.0`. Use `temperature` closer to `0.0`
              for analytical / multiple choice, and closer to `1.0` for creative and
              generative tasks.

              Note that even with `temperature` of `0.0`, the results will not be fully
              deterministic.

          thinking: Configuration for enabling Claude's extended thinking.

              When enabled, responses include `thinking` content blocks showing Claude's
              thinking process before the final answer. Requires a minimum budget of 1,024
              tokens and counts towards your `max_tokens` limit.

              See
              [extended thinking](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking)
              for details.

          tool_choice: How the model should use the provided tools. The model can use a specific tool,
              any available tool, decide by itself, or not use tools at all.

          tools: Definitions of tools that the model may use.

              If you include `tools` in your API request, the model may return `tool_use`
              content blocks that represent the model's use of those tools. You can then run
              those tools using the tool input generated by the model and then optionally
              return results back to the model using `tool_result` content blocks.

              Each tool definition includes:

              - `name`: Name of the tool.
              - `description`: Optional, but strongly-recommended description of the tool.
              - `input_schema`: [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) for the
                tool `input` shape that the model will produce in `tool_use` output content
                blocks.

              For example, if you defined `tools` as:

              ```json
              [
                {
                  "name": "get_stock_price",
                  "description": "Get the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.",
                  "input_schema": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                      "ticker": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The stock ticker symbol, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc."
                      }
                    },
                    "required": ["ticker"]
                  }
                }
              ]
              ```

              And then asked the model "What's the S&P 500 at today?", the model might produce
              `tool_use` content blocks in the response like this:

              ```json
              [
                {
                  "type": "tool_use",
                  "id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
                  "name": "get_stock_price",
                  "input": { "ticker": "^GSPC" }
                }
              ]
              ```

              You might then run your `get_stock_price` tool with `{"ticker": "^GSPC"}` as an
              input, and return the following back to the model in a subsequent `user`
              message:

              ```json
              [
                {
                  "type": "tool_result",
                  "tool_use_id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
                  "content": "259.75 USD"
                }
              ]
              ```

              Tools can be used for workflows that include running client-side tools and
              functions, or more generally whenever you want the model to produce a particular
              JSON structure of output.

              See our [guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/tool-use) for more details.

          top_k: Only sample from the top K options for each subsequent token.

              Used to remove "long tail" low probability responses.
              [Learn more technical details here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-sample-from-language-models-682bceb97277).

              Recommended for advanced use cases only. You usually only need to use
              `temperature`.

          top_p: Use nucleus sampling.

              In nucleus sampling, we compute the cumulative distribution over all the options
              for each subsequent token in decreasing probability order and cut it off once it
              reaches a particular probability specified by `top_p`. You should either alter
              `temperature` or `top_p`, but not both.

              Recommended for advanced use cases only. You usually only need to use
              `temperature`.

        Args:
          max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens to generate before stopping.

              Note that our models may stop _before_ reaching this maximum. This parameter
              only specifies the absolute maximum number of tokens to generate.

              Different models have different maximum values for this parameter. See
              [models](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/models-overview) for details.

          messages: Input messages.

              Our models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant`
              conversational turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior
              conversational turns with the `messages` parameter, and the model then generates
              the next `Message` in the conversation. Consecutive `user` or `assistant` turns
              in your request will be combined into a single turn.

              Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can
              specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and
              `assistant` messages.

              If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will
              continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to
              constrain part of the model's response.

              Example with a single `user` message:

              ```json
              [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }]
              ```

              Example with multiple conversational turns:

              ```json
              [
                { "role": "user", "content": "Hello there." },
                { "role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?" },
                { "role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?" }
              ]
              ```

              Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:

              ```json
              [
                {
                  "role": "user",
                  "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"
                },
                { "role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is (" }
              ]
              ```

              Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of
              content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for
              `content` is shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The
              following input messages are equivalent:

              ```json
              { "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }

              ```json
              { "role": "user", "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Hello, Claude" }] }
              ```

              Starting with Claude 3 models, you can also send image content blocks:

                ]

              See
              [extended thinking](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking)
              for details.

          tool_choice: How the model should use the provided tools. The model can use a specific tool,
              any available tool, decide by itself, or not use tools at all.

          tools: Definitions of tools that the model may use.

              If you include `tools` in your API request, the model may return `tool_use`
              content blocks that represent the model's use of those tools. You can then run
              those tools using the tool input generated by the model and then optionally
              return results back to the model using `tool_result` content blocks.

              Each tool definition includes:

              - `name`: Name of the tool.
              - `description`: Optional, but strongly-recommended description of the tool.
              - `input_schema`: [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) for the
                tool `input` shape that the model will produce in `tool_use` output content
                blocks.

              For example, if you defined `tools` as:

              ```json
              [
                {
                  "name": "get_stock_price",
                  "description": "Get the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.",
                  "input_schema": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                      "ticker": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The stock ticker symbol, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc."
                      }
                    },
                    "required": ["ticker"]
                  }
                }
              ]
              ```

              And then asked the model "What's the S&P 500 at today?", the model might produce
              `tool_use` content blocks in the response like this:

              ```json
              [
                {
                  "type": "tool_use",
                  "id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
                  "name": "get_stock_price",
                  "input": { "ticker": "^GSPC" }
                }
              ]
              ```

              You might then run your `get_stock_price` tool with `{"ticker": "^GSPC"}` as an
              input, and return the following back to the model in a subsequent `user`
              message:

              ```json
              [
                {
                  "type": "tool_result",
                  "tool_use_id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
                  "content": "259.75 USD"
                }
              ]
              ```

              Tools can be used for workflows that include running client-side tools and
              functions, or more generally whenever you want the model to produce a particular
              JSON structure of output.

              See our [guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/tool-use) for more details.

          top_k: Only sample from the top K options for each subsequent token.

              Used to remove "long tail" low probability responses.
              [Learn more technical details here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-sample-from-language-models-682bceb97277).

              Recommended for advanced use cases only. You usually only need to use
              `temperature`.

          top_p: Use nucleus sampling.

              In nucleus sampling, we compute the cumulative distribution over all the options
              for each subsequent token in decreasing probability order and cut it off once it
              reaches a particular probability specified by `top_p`. You should either alter
              `temperature` or `top_p`, but not both.

              Recommended for advanced use cases only. You usually only need to use
              `temperature`.

          messages: Input messages.

              Our models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant`
              conversational turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior
              conversational turns with the `messages` parameter, and the model then generates
              the next `Message` in the conversation. Consecutive `user` or `assistant` turns
              in your request will be combined into a single turn.

              Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can
              specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and
              `assistant` messages.

              If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will
              continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to
              constrain part of the model's response.

              Example with a single `user` message:

              ```json
              [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }]
              ```

              Example with multiple conversational turns:

              ```json
              [
                { "role": "user", "content": "Hello there." },
                { "role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?" },
                { "role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?" }
              ]
              ```

              Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:

              ```json
              [
                {
                  "role": "user",
                  "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"
                },
                { "role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is (" }
              ]
              ```

              Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of
              content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for
              `content` is shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The
              following input messages are equivalent:

              ```json
              { "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }
              ```

              ```json
              { "role": "user", "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Hello, Claude" }] }
              ```

              Starting with Claude 3 models, you can also send image content blocks:

              ```json
              {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                  {
                    "type": "image",
                    "source": {
                      "type": "base64",
                      "media_type": "image/jpeg",
                      "data": "/9j/4AAQSkZJRg..."
                    }
                  },
                  { "type": "text", "text": "What is in this image?" }
                ]
              }
              ```

              We currently support the `base64` source type for images, and the `image/jpeg`,
              `image/png`, `image/gif`, and `image/webp` media types.

              See [examples](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-examples#vision) for
              more input examples.

              Note that if you want to include a
              [system prompt](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/system-prompts), you can use
              the top-level `system` parameter — there is no `"system"` role for input
              messages in the Messages API.

              There is a limit of 100000 messages in a single request.

          model: The model that will complete your prompt.\n\nSee
              [models](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/models-overview) for additional
              details and options.

          system: System prompt.

              A system prompt is a way of providing context and instructions to Claude, such
              as specifying a particular goal or role. See our
              [guide to system prompts](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/system-prompts).

          thinking: Configuration for enabling Claude's extended thinking.

              When enabled, responses include `thinking` content blocks showing Claude's
              thinking process before the final answer. Requires a minimum budget of 1,024
              tokens and counts towards your `max_tokens` limit.

              See
              [extended thinking](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking)
              for details.

          tool_choice: How the model should use the provided tools. The model can use a specific tool,
              any available tool, decide by itself, or not use tools at all.

          tools: Definitions of tools that the model may use.

              If you include `tools` in your API request, the model may return `tool_use`
              content blocks that represent the model's use of those tools. You can then run
              those tools using the tool input generated by the model and then optionally
              return results back to the model using `tool_result` content blocks.

              Each tool definition includes:

              - `name`: Name of the tool.
              - `description`: Optional, but strongly-recommended description of the tool.
              - `input_schema`: [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) for the
                tool `input` shape that the model will produce in `tool_use` output content
                blocks.

              For example, if you defined `tools` as:

              ```json
              [
                {
                  "name": "get_stock_price",
                  "description": "Get the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.",
                  "input_schema": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                      "ticker": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The stock ticker symbol, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc."
                      }
                    },
                    "required": ["ticker"]
                  }
                }
              ]
              ```

              And then asked the model "What's the S&P 500 at today?", the model might produce
              `tool_use` content blocks in the response like this:

              ```json
              [
                {
                  "type": "tool_use",
                  "id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
                  "name": "get_stock_price",
                  "input": { "ticker": "^GSPC" }
                }
              ]
              ```

              You might then run your `get_stock_price` tool with `{"ticker": "^GSPC"}` as an
              input, and return the following back to the model in a subsequent `user`
              message:

              ```json
              [
                {
                  "type": "tool_result",
                  "tool_use_id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
                  "content": "259.75 USD"
                }
              ]
              ```

              Tools can be used for workflows that include running client-side tools and
              functions, or more generally whenever you want the model to produce a particular
              JSON structure of output.
