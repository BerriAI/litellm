class OperationMetadata(proto.Message):
    r"""Represents the metadata of the long-running operation.

    Attributes:
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The time the operation was
            created.
        end_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The time the operation finished
            running.
        target (str):
            Output only. Server-defined resource path for
            the target of the
        verb (str):
            Output only. Name of the verb executed by the
            operation.
        status_message (str):
            Output only. Human-readable status of the
            operation, if any.
        requested_cancellation (bool):
            Output only. Identifies whether the user has requested
            cancellation of the operation. Operations that have
            successfully been cancelled have [Operation.error][] value
            with a [google.rpc.Status.code][google.rpc.Status.code] of
            1, corresponding to ``Code.CANCELLED``.
        api_version (str):
            Output only. API version used to start the
            operation.
