                Custom options for the client.

                1. The ``api_endpoint`` property can be used to override the
                default endpoint provided by the client when ``transport`` is
                not explicitly provided. Only if this property is not set and
                ``transport`` was not explicitly provided, the endpoint is
                determined by the GOOGLE_API_USE_MTLS_ENDPOINT environment
                variable, which have one of the following values:
                "always" (always use the default mTLS endpoint), "never" (always
                use the default regular endpoint) and "auto" (auto-switch to the
                default mTLS endpoint if client certificate is present; this is
                the default value).

                2. If the GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE environment variable
                is "true", then the ``client_cert_source`` property can be used
                to provide a client certificate for mTLS transport. If
                not provided, the default SSL client certificate will be used if
                present. If GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE is "false" or not
                set, no client certificate will be used.

                3. The ``universe_domain`` property can be used to override the
                default "googleapis.com" universe. Note that ``api_endpoint``
                property still takes precedence; and ``universe_domain`` is
                currently not supported for mTLS.

                your own client library.

                the request will be overwritten. Set the update_mask to

                -  ``offline_storage_ttl_days``

                Field mask is used to specify the fields to be
                overwritten in the Features resource by the update. The
                fields specified in the update_mask are relative to the
                resource, not the full request. A field will be
                overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not
                provide a mask then only the non-empty fields present in
                the request will be overwritten. Set the update_mask to
                ``*`` to override all fields.

                Updatable fields:

                -  ``description``
                -  ``labels``
                -  ``disable_monitoring`` (Not supported for
                   FeatureRegistry Feature)

                This corresponds to the ``update_mask`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            retry (google.api_core.retry_async.AsyncRetry): Designation of what errors, if any,
                should be retried.
            timeout (float): The timeout for this request.
            metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, str]]): Strings which should be
                sent along with the request as metadata.

        Returns:

                Feature Metadata information.

                Features. Format:
                ``projects/{project}/locations/{location}``

                This corresponds to the ``location`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            query (:class:`str`):
                Query string that is a conjunction of field-restricted
                queries and/or field-restricted filters.
                Field-restricted queries and filters can be combined
                using ``AND`` to form a conjunction.

                A field query is in the form FIELD:QUERY. This
                implicitly checks if QUERY exists as a substring within
                Feature's FIELD. The QUERY and the FIELD are converted
                to a sequence of words (i.e. tokens) for comparison.
                This is done by:

                -  Removing leading/trailing whitespace and tokenizing
                   the search value. Characters that are not one of
                   alphanumeric ``[a-zA-Z0-9]``, underscore ``_``, or
                   asterisk ``*`` are treated as delimiters for tokens.
                   ``*`` is treated as a wildcard that matches
                   characters within a token.
                -  Ignoring case.
                -  Prepending an asterisk to the first and appending an
                   asterisk to the last token in QUERY.

                A QUERY must be either a singular token or a phrase. A
                phrase is one or multiple words enclosed in double
                quotation marks ("). With phrases, the order of the
                words is important. Words in the phrase must be matching
                in order and consecutively.

                Supported FIELDs for field-restricted queries:

                -  ``feature_id``
                -  ``description``
                -  ``entity_type_id``

                Examples:

                -  ``feature_id: foo`` --> Matches a Feature with ID
                   containing the substring ``foo`` (eg. ``foo``,
                   ``foofeature``, ``barfoo``).
                -  ``feature_id: foo*feature`` --> Matches a Feature
                   with ID containing the substring ``foo*feature`` (eg.
                   ``foobarfeature``).
                -  ``feature_id: foo AND description: bar`` --> Matches
                   a Feature with ID containing the substring ``foo``
                   and description containing the substring ``bar``.

                Besides field queries, the following exact-match filters
                are supported. The exact-match filters do not support
                wildcards. Unlike field-restricted queries, exact-match
                filters are case-sensitive.

                -  ``feature_id``: Supports = comparisons.
                -  ``description``: Supports = comparisons. Multi-token
                   filters should be enclosed in quotes.
                -  ``entity_type_id``: Supports = comparisons.
                -  ``value_type``: Supports = and != comparisons.
                -  ``labels``: Supports key-value equality as well as
                   key presence.
                -  ``featurestore_id``: Supports = comparisons.

                Examples:

                -  ``description = "foo bar"`` --> Any Feature with
                   description exactly equal to ``foo bar``
                -  ``value_type = DOUBLE`` --> Features whose type is
                   DOUBLE.
                -  ``labels.active = yes AND labels.env = prod`` -->
                   Features having both (active: yes) and (env: prod)
                   labels.
                -  ``labels.env: *`` --> Any Feature which has a label
                   with ``env`` as the key.

                This corresponds to the ``query`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            retry (google.api_core.retry_async.AsyncRetry): Designation of what errors, if any,
                should be retried.
            timeout (float): The timeout for this request.

                A ``Policy`` is a collection of ``bindings``. A

                accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite).
                A ``role`` is a named list of permissions (defined by
                IAM or configured by users). A ``binding`` can
                optionally specify a ``condition``, which is a logic
                expression that further constrains the role binding
                based on attributes about the request and/or target
                resource.

                It is used to specify access control policies for Cloud
                Platform resources.
                A ``Policy`` is a collection of ``bindings``. A
                ``binding`` binds one or more ``members`` to a single
                ``role``. Members can be user accounts, service
                accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite).
                A ``role`` is a named list of permissions (defined by
                IAM or configured by users). A ``binding`` can
                optionally specify a ``condition``, which is a logic
                expression that further constrains the role binding
                based on attributes about the request and/or target
                resource.
