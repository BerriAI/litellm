    of a pipeline is that the pipeline will continue to run until no
    more tasks can be executed, also known as
    PIPELINE_FAILURE_POLICY_FAIL_SLOW. However, if a pipeline is set to
    PIPELINE_FAILURE_POLICY_FAIL_FAST, it will stop scheduling any new
    tasks when a task has failed. Any scheduled tasks will continue to
    completion.

            behavior.

            Indicates that the pipeline should continue
            to run until all possible tasks have been
            scheduled and completed.
        PIPELINE_FAILURE_POLICY_FAIL_FAST (2):
