            should be forwarded to that DeployedModel.

            If a DeployedModel's ID is not listed in this
            map, then it receives no traffic.

            The traffic percentage values must add up to

        encryption_spec (google.cloud.aiplatform_v1beta1.types.EncryptionSpec):
            Customer-managed encryption key spec for an
            Endpoint. If set, this Endpoint and all

            `network <https://cloud.google.com//compute/docs/networks-and-firewalls#networks>`__
            to which the Endpoint should be peered.

    This message has `oneof`_ fields (mutually exclusive fields).
    For each oneof, at most one member field can be set at the same time.
    Setting any member of the oneof automatically clears all other
    members.

    .. _oneof: https://proto-plus-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#oneofs-mutually-exclusive-fields

    Attributes:
        dedicated_resources (google.cloud.aiplatform_v1beta1.types.DedicatedResources):
            A description of resources that are dedicated
            to the DeployedModel, and that need a higher
            degree of manual configuration.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``prediction_resources``.
        automatic_resources (google.cloud.aiplatform_v1beta1.types.AutomaticResources):
            A description of resources that to large
            degree are decided by Vertex AI, and require
            only a modest additional configuration.

            This field is a member of `oneof`_ ``prediction_resources``.
        shared_resources (str):
            The resource name of the shared DeploymentResourcePool to

        id (str):
            Immutable. The ID of the DeployedModel. If not provided upon
            deployment, Vertex AI will generate a value for this ID.

            This value should be 1-10 characters, and valid characters
            are ``/[0-9]/``.
        model (str):
            Required. The resource name of the Model that this is the
            deployment of. Note that the Model may be in a different
            location than the DeployedModel's Endpoint.

            The resource name may contain version id or version alias to
            specify the version. Example:
            ``projects/{project}/locations/{location}/models/{model}@2``
            or
            ``projects/{project}/locations/{location}/models/{model}@golden``
            if no version is specified, the default version will be
            deployed.
        model_version_id (str):
            Output only. The version ID of the model that
            is deployed.
        display_name (str):

            was created.
        explanation_spec (google.cloud.aiplatform_v1beta1.types.ExplanationSpec):
            Explanation configuration for this DeployedModel.

            When deploying a Model using
            [EndpointService.DeployModel][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1beta1.EndpointService.DeployModel],
            this value overrides the value of
            [Model.explanation_spec][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1beta1.Model.explanation_spec].

            [explanation_spec][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1beta1.DeployedModel.explanation_spec]

            [explanation_spec][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1beta1.DeployedModel.explanation_spec]

            [explanation_spec][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1beta1.DeployedModel.explanation_spec]
            will be used for the explanation configuration.
        disable_explanations (bool):
            If true, deploy the model without explainable feature,
            regardless the existence of
            [Model.explanation_spec][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1beta1.Model.explanation_spec]
            or
            [explanation_spec][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1beta1.DeployedModel.explanation_spec].
        service_account (str):
            The service account that the DeployedModel's container runs
            as. Specify the email address of the service account. If
            this service account is not specified, the container runs as
            a service account that doesn't have access to the resource
            project.

            Users deploying the Model must have the
            ``iam.serviceAccounts.actAs`` permission on this service
            account.
        enable_container_logging (bool):
            If true, the container of the DeployedModel instances will
            send ``stderr`` and ``stdout`` streams to Cloud Logging.

            Only supported for custom-trained Models and AutoML Tabular
            Models.
        enable_access_logging (bool):
            If true, online prediction access logs are
            sent to Cloud Logging.
            These logs are like standard server access logs,
            containing information like timestamp and
            latency for each prediction request.

            Note that logs may incur a cost, especially if
            your project receives prediction requests at a
            high queries per second rate (QPS). Estimate
            your costs before enabling this option.
        private_endpoints (google.cloud.aiplatform_v1beta1.types.PrivateEndpoints):
            Output only. Provide paths for users to send
            predict/explain/health requests directly to the deployed
            model services running on Cloud via private services access.
            This field is populated if
            [network][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1beta1.Endpoint.network]
            is configured.
