                default endpoint provided by the client when ``transport`` is
                not explicitly provided. Only if this property is not set and
                ``transport`` was not explicitly provided, the endpoint is
                determined by the GOOGLE_API_USE_MTLS_ENDPOINT environment
                variable, which have one of the following values:
                "always" (always use the default mTLS endpoint), "never" (always
                use the default regular endpoint) and "auto" (auto-switch to the
                default mTLS endpoint if client certificate is present; this is
                the default value).

                2. If the GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE environment variable
                is "true", then the ``client_cert_source`` property can be used
                to provide a client certificate for mTLS transport. If
                not provided, the default SSL client certificate will be used if
                present. If GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE is "false" or not
                set, no client certificate will be used.

                3. The ``universe_domain`` property can be used to override the
                default "googleapis.com" universe. Note that ``api_endpoint``
                property still takes precedence; and ``universe_domain`` is

            query (:class:`str`):
                Optional. A query string for searching for projects that
                the caller has ``resourcemanager.projects.get``
                permission to. If multiple fields are included in the
                query, then it will return results that match any of the
                fields. Some eligible fields are:

                -  **``displayName``, ``name``**: Filters by
                   displayName.
                -  **``parent``**: Project's parent (for example:
                   ``folders/123``, ``organizations/*``). Prefer
                   ``parent`` field over ``parent.type`` and
                   ``parent.id``.
                -  **``parent.type``**: Parent's type: ``folder`` or
                   ``organization``.
                -  **``parent.id``**: Parent's id number (for example:
                   ``123``).
                -  **``id``, ``projectId``**: Filters by projectId.
                -  **``state``, ``lifecycleState``**: Filters by state.
                -  **``labels``**: Filters by label name or value.
                -  **``labels.<key>`` (where ``<key>`` is the name of a
                   label)**: Filters by label name.

                Search expressions are case insensitive.

                Some examples queries:

                -  **``name:how*``**: The project's name starts with
                   "how".
                -  **``name:Howl``**: The project's name is ``Howl`` or
                   ``howl``.
                -  **``name:HOWL``**: Equivalent to above.
                -  **``NAME:howl``**: Equivalent to above.
                -  **``labels.color:*``**: The project has the label
                   ``color``.
                -  **``labels.color:red``**: The project's label
                   ``color`` has the value ``red``.
                -  **``labels.color:red labels.size:big``**: The
                   project's label ``color`` has the value ``red`` or
                   its label ``size`` has the value ``big``.

                If no query is specified, the call will return projects
                for which the user has the
                ``resourcemanager.projects.get`` permission.

                This corresponds to the ``query`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            retry (google.api_core.retry_async.AsyncRetry): Designation of what errors, if any,
                should be retried.
            timeout (float): The timeout for this request.
            metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, Union[str, bytes]]]): Key/value pairs which should be
                sent along with the request as metadata. Normally, each value must be of type `str`,

                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this

            update_mask (:class:`google.protobuf.field_mask_pb2.FieldMask`):
                Optional. An update mask to
                selectively update fields.

            metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, Union[str, bytes]]]): Key/value pairs which should be

                   controls for Google Cloud resources.

                   A Policy is a collection of bindings. A binding binds
                   one or more members, or principals, to a single role.
                   Principals can be user accounts, service accounts,
                   Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A role
                   is a named list of permissions; each role can be an
                   IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.

                   For some types of Google Cloud resources, a binding
                   can also specify a condition, which is a logical
                   expression that allows access to a resource only if
                   the expression evaluates to true. A condition can add
                   constraints based on attributes of the request, the
                   resource, or both. To learn which resources support
                   conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
                   documentation](\ https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

        CAUTION: This method will replace the existing policy, and
        cannot be used to append additional IAM settings.

        Note: Removing service accounts from policies or changing their
        roles can render services completely inoperable. It is important
        to understand how the service account is being used before
        removing or updating its roles.

        The following constraints apply when using ``setIamPolicy()``:

        -  Project does not support ``allUsers`` and
           ``allAuthenticatedUsers`` as ``members`` in a ``Binding`` of
           a ``Policy``.

        -  The owner role can be granted to a ``user``,
           ``serviceAccount``, or a group that is part of an
           organization. For example, group@myownpersonaldomain.com
           could be added as an owner to a project in the
           myownpersonaldomain.com organization, but not the
           examplepetstore.com organization.

        -  Service accounts can be made owners of a project directly
           without any restrictions. However, to be added as an owner, a
           user must be invited using the Cloud Platform console and
           must accept the invitation.

        -  A user cannot be granted the owner role using
           ``setIamPolicy()``. The user must be granted the owner role
           using the Cloud Platform Console and must explicitly accept
           the invitation.

        -  Invitations to grant the owner role cannot be sent using
           ``setIamPolicy()``; they must be sent only using the Cloud
           Platform Console.

        -  If the project is not part of an organization, there must be
           at least one owner who has accepted the Terms of Service
           (ToS) agreement in the policy. Calling ``setIamPolicy()`` to
           remove the last ToS-accepted owner from the policy will fail.
           This restriction also applies to legacy projects that no
           longer have owners who have accepted the ToS. Edits to IAM
           policies will be rejected until the lack of a ToS-accepting
           owner is rectified. If the project is part of an
           organization, you can remove all owners, potentially making
           the organization inaccessible.
