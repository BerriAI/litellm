                default endpoint provided by the client when ``transport`` is
                not explicitly provided. Only if this property is not set and
                ``transport`` was not explicitly provided, the endpoint is
                determined by the GOOGLE_API_USE_MTLS_ENDPOINT environment
                variable, which have one of the following values:
                "always" (always use the default mTLS endpoint), "never" (always
                use the default regular endpoint) and "auto" (auto-switch to the
                default mTLS endpoint if client certificate is present; this is
                the default value).

                2. If the GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE environment variable
                is "true", then the ``client_cert_source`` property can be used
                to provide a client certificate for mTLS transport. If
                not provided, the default SSL client certificate will be used if
                present. If GOOGLE_API_USE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE is "false" or not
                set, no client certificate will be used.

                3. The ``universe_domain`` property can be used to override the
                default "googleapis.com" universe. Note that ``api_endpoint``
                property still takes precedence; and ``universe_domain`` is

                return. If no search criteria is specified then all
                accessible folders will be returned.

                Query expressions can be used to restrict results based
                upon displayName, state and parent, where the operators

                use escaped quotes for values that include whitespace to
                prevent unexpected behavior.

                   | displayName             | Filters by displayName.                |
                   | parent                  | Filters by parent (for example: folders/123). |

                Some example queries are:

                -  Query ``displayName=Test*`` returns Folder resources
                   whose display name starts with "Test".
                -  Query ``state=ACTIVE`` returns Folder resources with
                   ``state`` set to ``ACTIVE``.
                -  Query ``parent=folders/123`` returns Folder resources
                   that have ``folders/123`` as a parent resource.
                -  Query ``parent=folders/123 AND state=ACTIVE`` returns
                   active Folder resources that have ``folders/123`` as
                   a parent resource.
                -  Query ``displayName=\\"Test String\\"`` returns
                   Folder resources with display names that include both
                   "Test" and "String".

                should not be set.
            retry (google.api_core.retry_async.AsyncRetry): Designation of what errors, if any,

            folder (:class:`google.cloud.resourcemanager_v3.types.Folder`):

                include the ``name`` field, which cannot be changed.

                This corresponds to the ``folder`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this

            update_mask (:class:`google.protobuf.field_mask_pb2.FieldMask`):

                ``display_name`` can be updated.

                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            retry (google.api_core.retry_async.AsyncRetry): Designation of what errors, if any,
                should be retried.
            timeout (float): The timeout for this request.
            metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, Union[str, bytes]]]): Key/value pairs which should be
                sent along with the request as metadata. Normally, each value must be of type `str`,
                but for metadata keys ending with the suffix `-bin`, the corresponding values must

                An object representing a long-running operation.

            google.iam.v1.policy_pb2.Policy:
                An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
                   controls for Google Cloud resources.

                   A Policy is a collection of bindings. A binding binds
                   one or more members, or principals, to a single role.
                   Principals can be user accounts, service accounts,
                   Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A role
                   is a named list of permissions; each role can be an
                   IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.

                   For some types of Google Cloud resources, a binding
                   can also specify a condition, which is a logical
                   expression that allows access to a resource only if
                   the expression evaluates to true. A condition can add
                   constraints based on attributes of the request, the
                   resource, or both. To learn which resources support
                   conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
                   documentation](\ https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).
