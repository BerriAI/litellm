class ImageDataset(datasets._Dataset):
    """A managed image dataset resource for Vertex AI.

    Use this class to work with a managed image dataset. To create a managed
    image dataset, you need a datasource file in CSV format and a schema file in
    YAML format. A schema is optional for a custom model. You put the CSV file
    and the schema into Cloud Storage buckets.

    Use image data for the following objectives:

    * Single-label classification. For more information, see
    [Prepare image training data for single-label classification](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/image-data/classification/prepare-data#single-label-classification).
    * Multi-label classification. For more information, see [Prepare image training data for multi-label classification](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/image-data/classification/prepare-data#multi-label-classification).
    * Object detection. For more information, see [Prepare image training data
      for object detection](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/image-data/object-detection/prepare-data).

    The following code shows you how to create an image dataset by importing data from
    a CSV datasource file and a YAML schema file. The schema file you use
    depends on whether your image dataset is used for single-label
    classification, multi-label classification, or object detection.

    ```py
    my_dataset = aiplatform.ImageDataset.create(
        display_name="my-image-dataset",
        gcs_source=['gs://path/to/my/image-dataset.csv'],
        import_schema_uri=['gs://path/to/my/schema.yaml']
    )

        """Creates a new image dataset.

        Optionally imports data into the dataset when a source and
        `import_schema_uri` are passed in.

        Args:
            display_name (str):
                Optional. The user-defined name of the dataset. The name must
                contain 128 or fewer UTF-8 characters.
            gcs_source (Union[str, Sequence[str]]):
                Optional. The URI to one or more Google Cloud Storage buckets
                that contain your datasets. For example, `str:
                "gs://bucket/file.csv"` or `Sequence[str]:
                ["gs://bucket/file1.csv", "gs://bucket/file2.csv"]`.
            import_schema_uri (str):
                Optional. A URI for a YAML file stored in Cloud Storage that
                describes the import schema used to validate the
                dataset. The schema is an
                [OpenAPI 3.0.2 Schema](https://tinyurl.com/y538mdwt) object.
            data_item_labels (Dict):
                Optional. A dictionary of label information. Each dictionary
                item contains a label and a label key. Each image in the dataset
                includes one dictionary of label information. If a data item is
                added or merged into a dataset, and that data item contains an
                image that's identical to an image thatâ€™s already in the
                dataset, then the data items are merged. If two identical labels
                are detected during the merge, each with a different label key,
                then one of the label and label key dictionary items is randomly
                chosen to be into the merged data item. Images and documents are
                compared using their binary data (bytes), not on their content.
                If annotation labels are referenced in a schema specified by the
                `import_schema_url` parameter, then the labels in the
                `data_item_labels` dictionary are overriden by the annotations.
            project (str):
                Optional. The name of the Google Cloud project to which this
                `ImageDataset` is uploaded. This overrides the project that
                was set by `aiplatform.init`.
            location (str):
                Optional. The Google Cloud region where this dataset is uploaded. This
                region overrides the region that was set by `aiplatform.init`.
            credentials (auth_credentials.Credentials):
                Optional. The credentials that are used to upload the
                `ImageDataset`. These credentials override the credentials set
                by `aiplatform.init`.
            request_metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, str]]):
                Optional. Strings that contain metadata that's sent with the request.
            labels (Dict[str, str]):
                Optional. Labels with user-defined metadata to organize your
                Vertex AI Tensorboards. The maximum length of a key and of a
                value is 64 unicode characters. Labels and keys can contain only
                lowercase letters, numeric characters, underscores, and dashes.
                International characters are allowed. No more than 64 user
                labels can be associated with one Tensorboard (system labels are
                excluded). For more information and examples of using labels, see
                [Using labels to organize Google Cloud Platform resources](https://goo.gl/xmQnxf).
                System reserved label keys are prefixed with
                `aiplatform.googleapis.com/` and are immutable.
            encryption_spec_key_name (Optional[str]):
                Optional. The Cloud KMS resource identifier of the customer
                managed encryption key that's used to protect the dataset. The
                format of the key is
                `projects/my-project/locations/my-region/keyRings/my-kr/cryptoKeys/my-key`.
                The key needs to be in the same region as where the compute
                resource is created.

                If `encryption_spec_key_name` is set, this image dataset and
                all of its sub-resources are secured by this key.

                This `encryption_spec_key_name` overrides the
                `encryption_spec_key_name` set by `aiplatform.init`.
            sync (bool):
                If `true`, the `create` method creates an image dataset
                synchronously. If `false`, the `create` method creates an image
                dataset asynchronously.
            create_request_timeout (float):
                Optional. The number of seconds for the timeout of the create
                request.

        Returns:
            image_dataset (ImageDataset):
                An instantiated representation of the managed `ImageDataset`
                resource.
