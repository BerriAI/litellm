    Attributes:
        content (str):
            The Google Cloud Storage location of the
            video on which to perform the prediction.

        time_segment_start (str):
            The beginning, inclusive, of the video's time
            segment on which to perform the prediction.
            Expressed as a number of seconds as measured
            from the start of the video, with "s" appended
            at the end. Fractions are allowed, up to a
