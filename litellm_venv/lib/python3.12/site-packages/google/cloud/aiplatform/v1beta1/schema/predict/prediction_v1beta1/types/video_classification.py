class VideoClassificationPredictionResult(proto.Message):
    r"""Prediction output format for Video Classification.

    Attributes:
        id (str):
            The resource ID of the AnnotationSpec that
            had been identified.
        display_name (str):
            The display name of the AnnotationSpec that
            had been identified.
        type_ (str):
            The type of the prediction. The requested
            types can be configured via parameters. This
            will be one of
            - segment-classification
            - shot-classification
            - one-sec-interval-classification
        time_segment_start (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            The beginning, inclusive, of the video's time
            segment in which the AnnotationSpec has been
            identified. Expressed as a number of seconds as
            measured from the start of the video, with
            fractions up to a microsecond precision, and
            with "s" appended at the end. Note that for
            'segment-classification' prediction type, this
            equals the original 'timeSegmentStart' from the
            input instance, for other types it is the start
            of a shot or a 1 second interval respectively.
        time_segment_end (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            The end, exclusive, of the video's time
            segment in which the AnnotationSpec has been
            identified. Expressed as a number of seconds as
            measured from the start of the video, with
            fractions up to a microsecond precision, and
            with "s" appended at the end. Note that for
            'segment-classification' prediction type, this
            equals the original 'timeSegmentEnd' from the
            input instance, for other types it is the end of
            a shot or a 1 second interval respectively.
        confidence (google.protobuf.wrappers_pb2.FloatValue):
            The Model's confidence in correction of this
            prediction, higher value means higher
            confidence.
