    Attributes:
        id (str):
            The resource ID of the AnnotationSpec that
            had been identified.
        display_name (str):
            The display name of the AnnotationSpec that
            had been identified.
        time_segment_start (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            The beginning, inclusive, of the video's time
            segment in which the AnnotationSpec has been
            identified. Expressed as a number of seconds as
            measured from the start of the video, with
            fractions up to a microsecond precision, and
            with "s" appended at the end.
        time_segment_end (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            The end, exclusive, of the video's time
            segment in which the AnnotationSpec has been
            identified. Expressed as a number of seconds as
            measured from the start of the video, with
            fractions up to a microsecond precision, and
            with "s" appended at the end.
        confidence (google.protobuf.wrappers_pb2.FloatValue):
            The Model's confidence in correction of this
            prediction, higher value means higher
            confidence.
