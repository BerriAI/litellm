            The training budget of creating this model, expressed in
            milli node hours i.e. 1,000 value in this field means 1 node
            hour. The actual metadata.costMilliNodeHours will be equal
            or less than this value. If further model training ceases to

            full budget and the metadata.successfulStopReason will be
            ``model-converged``. Note, node_hour = actual_hour \*
            number_of_nodes_involved. For modelType
            ``cloud``\ (default), the budget must be between 20,000 and
            900,000 milli node hours, inclusive. The default value is
            216,000 which represents one day in wall time, considering 9
            nodes are used. For model types ``mobile-tf-low-latency-1``,

            training budget must be between 1,000 and 100,000 milli node

            the early stopping feature. When false the early

            AutoML Image Object Detection might stop
            training before the entire training budget has
            been used.
