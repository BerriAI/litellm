    Attributes:
        ids (MutableSequence[int]):
            The resource IDs of the AnnotationSpecs that
            had been identified, ordered by the confidence
            score descendingly.
        display_names (MutableSequence[str]):
            The display names of the AnnotationSpecs that
            had been identified, order matches the IDs.
        text_segment_start_offsets (MutableSequence[int]):
            The start offsets, inclusive, of the text
            segment in which the AnnotationSpec has been
            identified. Expressed as a zero-based number of
            characters as measured from the start of the
            text snippet.
        text_segment_end_offsets (MutableSequence[int]):
            The end offsets, inclusive, of the text
            segment in which the AnnotationSpec has been
            identified. Expressed as a zero-based number of
            characters as measured from the start of the
            text snippet.
        confidences (MutableSequence[float]):
            The Model's confidences in correctness of the
            predicted IDs, higher value means higher
            confidence. Order matches the Ids.
