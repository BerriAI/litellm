class TensorboardRun(proto.Message):
    r"""TensorboardRun maps to a specific execution of a training job
    with a given set of hyperparameter values, model definition,
    dataset, etc

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Output only. Name of the TensorboardRun. Format:
            ``projects/{project}/locations/{location}/tensorboards/{tensorboard}/experiments/{experiment}/runs/{run}``
        display_name (str):
            Required. User provided name of this
            TensorboardRun. This value must be unique among
            all TensorboardRuns belonging to the same parent
            TensorboardExperiment.
        description (str):
            Description of this TensorboardRun.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Timestamp when this
            TensorboardRun was created.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Timestamp when this
            TensorboardRun was last updated.
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            The labels with user-defined metadata to organize your
            TensorboardRuns.

            This field will be used to filter and visualize Runs in the
            Tensorboard UI. For example, a Vertex AI training job can
            set a label aiplatform.googleapis.com/training_job_id=xxxxx
            to all the runs created within that job. An end user can set
            a label experiment_id=xxxxx for all the runs produced in a
            Jupyter notebook. These runs can be grouped by a label value
            and visualized together in the Tensorboard UI.

            Label keys and values can be no longer than 64 characters
            (Unicode codepoints), can only contain lowercase letters,
            numeric characters, underscores and dashes. International
            characters are allowed. No more than 64 user labels can be
            associated with one TensorboardRun (System labels are
            excluded).

            See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information and examples
            of labels. System reserved label keys are prefixed with
            "aiplatform.googleapis.com/" and are immutable.
        etag (str):
            Used to perform a consistent
            read-modify-write updates. If not set, a blind
            "overwrite" update happens.
