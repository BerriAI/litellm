    Python Module.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Required. Name of the environment variable.
            Must be a valid C identifier.
        value (str):
            Required. Variables that reference a $(VAR_NAME) are
            expanded using the previous defined environment variables in
            the container and any service environment variables. If a
            variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input
            string will be unchanged. The $(VAR_NAME) syntax can be
            escaped with a double $$, ie: $$(VAR_NAME). Escaped
            references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the
            variable exists or not.
