    For example, color is a feature that describes an apple.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Immutable. Name of the Feature. Format:
            ``projects/{project}/locations/{location}/featurestores/{featurestore}/entityTypes/{entity_type}/features/{feature}``
            ``projects/{project}/locations/{location}/featureGroups/{feature_group}/features/{feature}``

            The last part feature is assigned by the client. The feature
            can be up to 64 characters long and can consist only of
            ASCII Latin letters A-Z and a-z, underscore(_), and ASCII
            digits 0-9 starting with a letter. The value will be unique
            given an entity type.
        description (str):
            Description of the Feature.
        value_type (google.cloud.aiplatform_v1.types.Feature.ValueType):
            Immutable. Only applicable for Vertex AI
            Feature Store (Legacy). Type of Feature value.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Only applicable for Vertex AI
            Feature Store (Legacy). Timestamp when this
            EntityType was created.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Only applicable for Vertex AI
            Feature Store (Legacy). Timestamp when this
            EntityType was most recently updated.
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Optional. The labels with user-defined
            metadata to organize your Features.
            Label keys and values can be no longer than 64
            characters (Unicode codepoints), can only
            contain lowercase letters, numeric characters,
            underscores and dashes. International characters
            are allowed.

            See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information
            on and examples of labels. No more than 64 user
            labels can be associated with one Feature
            (System labels are excluded)."
            System reserved label keys are prefixed with
            "aiplatform.googleapis.com/" and are immutable.
        etag (str):
            Used to perform a consistent
            read-modify-write updates. If not set, a blind
            "overwrite" update happens.
        disable_monitoring (bool):
            Optional. Only applicable for Vertex AI Feature Store
            (Legacy). If not set, use the monitoring_config defined for
            the EntityType this Feature belongs to. Only Features with
            type
            ([Feature.ValueType][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.Feature.ValueType])
            BOOL, STRING, DOUBLE or INT64 can enable monitoring.

            If set to true, all types of data monitoring are disabled
            despite the config on EntityType.
        monitoring_stats_anomalies (MutableSequence[google.cloud.aiplatform_v1.types.Feature.MonitoringStatsAnomaly]):
            Output only. Only applicable for Vertex AI
            Feature Store (Legacy). The list of historical
            stats and anomalies with specified objectives.
        version_column_name (str):
            Only applicable for Vertex AI Feature Store. The name of the
            BigQuery Table/View column hosting data for this version. If
            no value is provided, will use feature_id.
        point_of_contact (str):
            Entity responsible for maintaining this
            feature. Can be comma separated list of email
            addresses or URIs.
