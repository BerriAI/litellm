class DeployedIndex(proto.Message):
    r"""A deployment of an Index. IndexEndpoints contain one or more
    DeployedIndexes.

    Attributes:
        id (str):
            Required. The user specified ID of the
            DeployedIndex. The ID can be up to 128
            characters long and must start with a letter and
            only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
            The ID must be unique within the project it is
            created in.
        index (str):
            Required. The name of the Index this is the
            deployment of. We may refer to this Index as the
            DeployedIndex's "original" Index.
        display_name (str):
            The display name of the DeployedIndex. If not provided upon
            creation, the Index's display_name is used.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. Timestamp when the DeployedIndex
            was created.
        private_endpoints (google.cloud.aiplatform_v1.types.IndexPrivateEndpoints):
            Output only. Provides paths for users to send requests
            directly to the deployed index services running on Cloud via
            private services access. This field is populated if
            [network][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.IndexEndpoint.network]
            is configured.
        index_sync_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The DeployedIndex may depend on various data on
            its original Index. Additionally when certain changes to the
            original Index are being done (e.g. when what the Index
            contains is being changed) the DeployedIndex may be
            asynchronously updated in the background to reflect these
            changes. If this timestamp's value is at least the
            [Index.update_time][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.Index.update_time]
            of the original Index, it means that this DeployedIndex and
            the original Index are in sync. If this timestamp is older,
            then to see which updates this DeployedIndex already
            contains (and which it does not), one must
            [list][google.longrunning.Operations.ListOperations] the
            operations that are running on the original Index. Only the
            successfully completed Operations with
            [update_time][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1.GenericOperationMetadata.update_time]
            equal or before this sync time are contained in this
            DeployedIndex.
        automatic_resources (google.cloud.aiplatform_v1.types.AutomaticResources):
            Optional. A description of resources that the DeployedIndex
            uses, which to large degree are decided by Vertex AI, and
            optionally allows only a modest additional configuration. If
            min_replica_count is not set, the default value is 2 (we
            don't provide SLA when min_replica_count=1). If
            max_replica_count is not set, the default value is
            min_replica_count. The max allowed replica count is 1000.
        dedicated_resources (google.cloud.aiplatform_v1.types.DedicatedResources):
            Optional. A description of resources that are dedicated to
            the DeployedIndex, and that need a higher degree of manual
            configuration. The field min_replica_count must be set to a
            value strictly greater than 0, or else validation will fail.
            We don't provide SLA when min_replica_count=1. If
            max_replica_count is not set, the default value is
            min_replica_count. The max allowed replica count is 1000.

            Available machine types for SMALL shard: e2-standard-2 and
            all machine types available for MEDIUM and LARGE shard.

            Available machine types for MEDIUM shard: e2-standard-16 and
            all machine types available for LARGE shard.

            Available machine types for LARGE shard: e2-highmem-16,
            n2d-standard-32.

            n1-standard-16 and n1-standard-32 are still available, but
            we recommend e2-standard-16 and e2-highmem-16 for cost
            efficiency.
        enable_access_logging (bool):
            Optional. If true, private endpoint's access
            logs are sent to Cloud Logging.

            These logs are like standard server access logs,
            containing information like timestamp and
            latency for each MatchRequest.

            Note that logs may incur a cost, especially if
            the deployed index receives a high queries per
            second rate (QPS). Estimate your costs before
            enabling this option.
        deployed_index_auth_config (google.cloud.aiplatform_v1.types.DeployedIndexAuthConfig):
            Optional. If set, the authentication is
            enabled for the private endpoint.
        reserved_ip_ranges (MutableSequence[str]):
            Optional. A list of reserved ip ranges under the VPC network
            that can be used for this DeployedIndex.

            If set, we will deploy the index within the provided ip
            ranges. Otherwise, the index might be deployed to any ip
            ranges under the provided VPC network.

            The value should be the name of the address
            (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/addresses)
            Example: ['vertex-ai-ip-range'].

            For more information about subnets and network IP ranges,
            please see
            https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/subnets#manually_created_subnet_ip_ranges.
        deployment_group (str):
            Optional. The deployment group can be no longer than 64
            characters (eg: 'test', 'prod'). If not set, we will use the
            'default' deployment group.

            Creating ``deployment_groups`` with ``reserved_ip_ranges``
            is a recommended practice when the peered network has
            multiple peering ranges. This creates your deployments from
            predictable IP spaces for easier traffic administration.
            Also, one deployment_group (except 'default') can only be
            used with the same reserved_ip_ranges which means if the
            deployment_group has been used with reserved_ip_ranges: [a,
            b, c], using it with [a, b] or [d, e] is disallowed.

            Note: we only support up to 5 deployment groups(not
            including 'default').
