            characters are allowed.

            See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information and examples
            of labels. System reserved label keys are prefixed with
            "aiplatform.googleapis.com/" and are immutable. Following
            system labels exist for each DataLabelingJob:

            -  "aiplatform.googleapis.com/schema": output only, its

            Customer-managed encryption key spec for a
            DataLabelingJob. If set, this DataLabelingJob
            will be secured by this key.

            Note: Annotations created in the DataLabelingJob
            are associated with the EncryptionSpec of the
            Dataset they are exported to.
        active_learning_config (google.cloud.aiplatform_v1.types.ActiveLearningConfig):
            Parameters that configure the active learning
            pipeline. Active learning will label the data
            incrementally via several iterations. For every
            iteration, it will select a batch of data based
            on the sampling strategy.
