    """Create a standardized httpx AsyncClient with MCP defaults.

    This function provides common defaults used throughout the MCP codebase:
    - follow_redirects=True (always enabled)
    - Default timeout of 30 seconds if not specified

    Args:
        headers: Optional headers to include with all requests.
        timeout: Request timeout as httpx.Timeout object.
            Defaults to 30 seconds if not specified.
        auth: Optional authentication handler.

    Returns:
        Configured httpx.AsyncClient instance with MCP defaults.

    Note:
        The returned AsyncClient must be used as a context manager to ensure
        proper cleanup of connections.

    Examples:
        # Basic usage with MCP defaults
        async with create_mcp_http_client() as client:
            response = await client.get("https://api.example.com")

        # With custom headers
        headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer token"}
        async with create_mcp_http_client(headers) as client:
            response = await client.get("/endpoint")

        # With both custom headers and timeout
        timeout = httpx.Timeout(60.0, read=300.0)
        async with create_mcp_http_client(headers, timeout) as client:
            response = await client.get("/long-request")

        # With authentication
        from httpx import BasicAuth
        auth = BasicAuth(username="user", password="pass")
        async with create_mcp_http_client(headers, timeout, auth) as client:
