SERVICE_INSTANCE_ID = "service.instance.id"
"""
The string ID of the service instance.
Note: MUST be unique for each instance of the same `service.namespace,service.name` pair (in other words
    `service.namespace,service.name,service.instance.id` triplet MUST be globally unique). The ID helps to
    distinguish instances of the same service that exist at the same time (e.g. instances of a horizontally scaled
    service).

    Implementations, such as SDKs, are recommended to generate a random Version 1 or Version 4 [RFC
    4122](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt) UUID, but are free to use an inherent unique ID as the source of
    this value if stability is desirable. In that case, the ID SHOULD be used as source of a UUID Version 5 and
    SHOULD use the following UUID as the namespace: `4d63009a-8d0f-11ee-aad7-4c796ed8e320`.

    UUIDs are typically recommended, as only an opaque value for the purposes of identifying a service instance is
    needed. Similar to what can be seen in the man page for the
    [`/etc/machine-id`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/machine-id.html) file, the underlying
    data, such as pod name and namespace should be treated as confidential, being the user's choice to expose it
    or not via another resource attribute.

    For applications running behind an application server (like unicorn), we do not recommend using one identifier
    for all processes participating in the application. Instead, it's recommended each division (e.g. a worker
    thread in unicorn) to have its own instance.id.

    It's not recommended for a Collector to set `service.instance.id` if it can't unambiguously determine the
    service instance that is generating that telemetry. For instance, creating an UUID based on `pod.name` will
    likely be wrong, as the Collector might not know from which container within that pod the telemetry originated.
    However, Collectors can set the `service.instance.id` if they can unambiguously determine the service instance
    for that telemetry. This is typically the case for scraping receivers, as they know the target address and
    port.

SERVICE_NAMESPACE = "service.namespace"
"""
A namespace for `service.name`.
Note: A string value having a meaning that helps to distinguish a group of services, for example the team name that owns a group of services. `service.name` is expected to be unique within the same namespace. If `service.namespace` is not specified in the Resource then `service.name` is expected to be unique for all services that have no explicit namespace defined (so the empty/unspecified namespace is simply one more valid namespace). Zero-length namespace string is assumed equal to unspecified namespace.
