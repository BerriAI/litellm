The [error codes](https://connect.build/docs/protocol/#error-codes) of the Connect request. Error codes are always string values.

Connect request metadata, `<key>` being the normalized Connect Metadata key (lowercase), the value being the metadata values.

`id` property of request or response. Since protocol allows id to be int, string, `null` or missing (for notifications), value is expected to be cast to string for simplicity. Use empty string in case of `null` value. Omit entirely if this is a notification.

The name of the (logical) method being called, must be equal to the $method part in the span name.

The full (logical) name of the service being called, including its package name, if applicable.
