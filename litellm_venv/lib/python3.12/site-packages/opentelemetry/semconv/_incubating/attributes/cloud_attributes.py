CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID = "cloud.account.id"
"""
The cloud account ID the resource is assigned to.
"""

CLOUD_AVAILABILITY_ZONE = "cloud.availability_zone"
"""
Cloud regions often have multiple, isolated locations known as zones to increase availability. Availability zone represents the zone where the resource is running.
Note: Availability zones are called "zones" on Alibaba Cloud and Google Cloud.
"""

CLOUD_PLATFORM = "cloud.platform"
"""
The cloud platform in use.
Note: The prefix of the service SHOULD match the one specified in `cloud.provider`.
"""

CLOUD_PROVIDER = "cloud.provider"
"""
Name of the cloud provider.
"""

CLOUD_REGION = "cloud.region"
"""
The geographical region the resource is running.
Note: Refer to your provider's docs to see the available regions, for example [Alibaba Cloud regions](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/40654.htm), [AWS regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/), [Azure regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/geographies/), [Google Cloud regions](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations), or [Tencent Cloud regions](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/213/6091).
"""

CLOUD_RESOURCE_ID = "cloud.resource_id"
"""
Cloud provider-specific native identifier of the monitored cloud resource (e.g. an [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) on AWS, a [fully qualified resource ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/resources/resources/get-by-id) on Azure, a [full resource name](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#full_resource_name) on GCP).
Note: On some cloud providers, it may not be possible to determine the full ID at startup,
    so it may be necessary to set `cloud.resource_id` as a span attribute instead.

    The exact value to use for `cloud.resource_id` depends on the cloud provider.
    The following well-known definitions MUST be used if you set this attribute and they apply:

    * **AWS Lambda:** The function [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html).
      Take care not to use the "invoked ARN" directly but replace any
      [alias suffix](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-aliases.html)
      with the resolved function version, as the same runtime instance may be invokable with
      multiple different aliases.
    * **GCP:** The [URI of the resource](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/full-resource-names)
    * **Azure:** The [Fully Qualified Resource ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/resources/resources/get-by-id) of the invoked function,
      *not* the function app, having the form
      `/subscriptions/<SUBSCIPTION_GUID>/resourceGroups/<RG>/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/<FUNCAPP>/functions/<FUNC>`.
      This means that a span attribute MUST be used, as an Azure function app can host multiple functions that would usually share
      a TracerProvider.
