The amount of level 2 memory cache available to the processor (in Bytes).

Family or generation of the CPU.

Model identifier. It provides more granular information about the CPU, distinguishing it from other CPUs within the same family.

Stepping or core revisions.

Processor manufacturer identifier. A maximum 12-character string.
Note: [CPUID](https://wiki.osdev.org/CPUID) command returns the vendor ID string in EBX, EDX and ECX registers. Writing these to memory in this order results in a 12-character string.

Unique host ID. For Cloud, this must be the instance_id assigned by the cloud provider. For non-containerized systems, this should be the `machine-id`. See the table below for the sources to use to determine the `machine-id` based on operating system.

VM image ID or host OS image ID. For Cloud, this value is from the provider.

Available IP addresses of the host, excluding loopback interfaces.

Available MAC addresses of the host, excluding loopback interfaces.

Type of host. For Cloud, this must be the machine type.
