      multiple different aliases.

      `/subscriptions/<SUBSCIPTION_GUID>/resourceGroups/<RG>/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/<FUNCAPP>/functions/<FUNC>`.

    A pseudo-ID for the cluster, set to the UID of the `kube-system` namespace.
    Note: K8s does not have support for obtaining a cluster ID. If this is ever
    added, we will recommend collecting the `k8s.cluster.uid` through the
    official APIs. In the meantime, we are able to use the `uid` of the
    `kube-system` namespace as a proxy for cluster ID. Read on for the
    rationale.

    Every object created in a K8s cluster is assigned a distinct UID. The
    `kube-system` namespace is used by Kubernetes itself and will exist
    for the lifetime of the cluster. Using the `uid` of the `kube-system`
    namespace is a reasonable proxy for the K8s ClusterID as it will only
    change if the cluster is rebuilt. Furthermore, Kubernetes UIDs are
    UUIDs as standardized by
    [ISO/IEC 9834-8 and ITU-T X.667](https://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/oid.html).
    Which states:

    > If generated according to one of the mechanisms defined in Rec.
      ITU-T X.667 | ISO/IEC 9834-8, a UUID is either guaranteed to be
      different from all other UUIDs generated before 3603 A.D., or is

    A namespace for `service.name`.
    Note: A string value having a meaning that helps to distinguish a group of services, for example the team name that owns a group of services. `service.name` is expected to be unique within the same namespace. If `service.namespace` is not specified in the Resource then `service.name` is expected to be unique for all services that have no explicit namespace defined (so the empty/unspecified namespace is simply one more valid namespace). Zero-length namespace string is assumed equal to unspecified namespace.

    The string ID of the service instance.
    Note: MUST be unique for each instance of the same `service.namespace,service.name` pair (in other words `service.namespace,service.name,service.instance.id` triplet MUST be globally unique). The ID helps to distinguish instances of the same service that exist at the same time (e.g. instances of a horizontally scaled service). It is preferable for the ID to be persistent and stay the same for the lifetime of the service instance, however it is acceptable that the ID is ephemeral and changes during important lifetime events for the service (e.g. service restarts). If the service has no inherent unique ID that can be used as the value of this attribute it is recommended to generate a random Version 1 or Version 4 RFC 4122 UUID (services aiming for reproducible UUIDs may also use Version 5, see RFC 4122 for more recommendations).
