ERROR_TYPE = "error.type"
"""
Describes a class of error the operation ended with.
Note: The `error.type` SHOULD be predictable and SHOULD have low cardinality.
    Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.

    The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
    Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
    should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
    additional filters are applied.

    If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.

    If a specific domain defines its own set of error identifiers (such as HTTP or gRPC status codes),
    it's RECOMMENDED to:

    * Use a domain-specific attribute
    * Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.
