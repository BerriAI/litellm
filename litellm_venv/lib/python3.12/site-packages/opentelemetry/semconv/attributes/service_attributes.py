SERVICE_NAME = "service.name"
"""
Logical name of the service.
Note: MUST be the same for all instances of horizontally scaled services. If the value was not specified, SDKs MUST fallback to `unknown_service:` concatenated with [`process.executable.name`](process.md#process), e.g. `unknown_service:bash`. If `process.executable.name` is not available, the value MUST be set to `unknown_service`.
"""

SERVICE_VERSION = "service.version"
"""
The version string of the service API or implementation. The format is not defined by these conventions.
