    Each distinct type of DataPoint represents the output of a specific
    aggregation function, the result of applying the DataPoint's
    associated function of to one or more measurements.

    All DataPoint types have three common fields:
    - Attributes includes key-value pairs associated with the data point
    - TimeUnixNano is required, set to the end time of the aggregation
    - StartTimeUnixNano is optional, but strongly encouraged for DataPoints
      having an AggregationTemporality field, as discussed below.

    Both TimeUnixNano and StartTimeUnixNano values are expressed as
    UNIX Epoch time in nanoseconds since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970.

    # TimeUnixNano

    This field is required, having consistent interpretation across
    DataPoint types.  TimeUnixNano is the moment corresponding to when
    the data point's aggregate value was captured.

    Data points with the 0 value for TimeUnixNano SHOULD be rejected
    by consumers.

    # StartTimeUnixNano

    StartTimeUnixNano in general allows detecting when a sequence of
    observations is unbroken.  This field indicates to consumers the
    start time for points with cumulative and delta
    AggregationTemporality, and it should be included whenever possible
    to support correct rate calculation.  Although it may be omitted
    when the start time is truly unknown, setting StartTimeUnixNano is
    strongly encouraged.
