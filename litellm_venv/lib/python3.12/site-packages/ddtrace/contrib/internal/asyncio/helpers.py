    Because the Executor can run the Thread immediately or after the
    coroutine is executed, we may have two different scenarios:
    * the Context is copied in the new Thread and the trace is sent twice
    * the coroutine flushes the Context and when the Thread copies the
    Context it is already empty (so it will be a root Span)

    To support both situations, we create a new Context that knows only what was
    the latest active Span when the new thread was created. In this new thread,
    we fallback to the thread-local ``Context`` storage.
