In typical usage, an address would be created by user input or from importing existing data, depending on the type of process. Advice on address input or editing: - Use an internationalization-ready address widget such as https://github.com/google/libaddressinput. - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside countries where that field is used.

"description": "Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address. Because values in `address_lines` do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (for example, \"Austin, TX\"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be \"envelope order\" for the country or region of the address. In places where this can vary (for example, Japan), `address_language` is used to make it explicit (for example, \"ja\" for large-to-small ordering and \"ja-Latn\" or \"en\" for small-to-large). In this way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a `region_code` with all remaining information placed in the `address_lines`. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a `region_code` and `address_lines` and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).",
