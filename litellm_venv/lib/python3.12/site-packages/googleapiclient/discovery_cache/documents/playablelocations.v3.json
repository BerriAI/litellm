It optimizes for selecting the highest ranking locations first, not to maximize the number of locations selected. Consider the following scenario: * Rank: A: 2, B: 1, C: 3. * Distance: A--200m--B--200m--C If spacing=250, it will pick the highest ranked location [B], not [A, C]. Note: Spacing works within the game object type itself, as well as the previous ones. Suppose three game object types, each with the following spacing: * X: 400m, Y: undefined, Z: 200m. 1. Add locations for X, within 400m of each other. 2. Add locations for Y, without any spacing. 3. Finally, add locations for Z within 200m of each other as well X and Y. The distance diagram between those locations end up as: * From->To. * X->X: 400m * Y->X, Y->Y: unspecified. * Z->X, Z->Y, Z->Z: 200m.",
