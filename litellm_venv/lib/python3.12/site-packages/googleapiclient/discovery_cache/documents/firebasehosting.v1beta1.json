"A CAA record, as defined in [RFC 6844](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6844). CAA, or Certificate Authority Authorization, records determine which Certificate Authorities (SSL certificate minting organizations) are authorized to mint a certificate for the domain name. Firebase Hosting uses `pki.goog` as its primary CA. CAA records cascade. A CAA record on `foo.com` also applies to `bar.foo.com` unless `bar.foo.com` has its own set of CAA records. CAA records are optional. If a domain name and its parents have no CAA records, all CAs are authorized to mint certificates on its behalf. In general, Hosting only asks you to modify CAA records when doing so is required to unblock SSL cert creation."
