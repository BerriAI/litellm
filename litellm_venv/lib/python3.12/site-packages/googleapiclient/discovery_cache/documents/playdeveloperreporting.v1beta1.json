Although those expected ranges have an upper and a lower bound, we only flag anomalies when the data has become unexpectedly _worse_, which usually corresponds to the case where the metric crosses the upper bound. Multiple contiguous datapoints in a timeline outside of the expected range will be grouped into a single anomaly. Therefore, an anomaly represents effectively a segment of a metric's timeline. The information stored in the `timeline_spec`, `dimensions` and `metric` can be used to fetch a full timeline with extended ragne for context. **Required permissions**: to access this resource, the calling user needs the _View app information (read-only)_ permission for the app.",

"description": "Singleton resource representing the set of Stuck Background Wakelocks metrics. This metric set contains PowerManager wakelock duration data combined with process state data to produce a normalized metric independent of user counts. **Supported aggregation periods:** * DAILY: metrics are aggregated in calendar date intervals. Due to historical constraints, the only supported timezone is `America/Los_Angeles`. **Supported metrics:** * `stuckBgWakelockRate` (`google.type.Decimal`): Percentage of distinct users in the aggregation period that had a wakelock held in the background for longer than 1 hour. * `stuckBgWakelockRate7dUserWeighted` (`google.type.Decimal`): Rolling average value of `stuckBgWakelockRate` in the last 7 days. The daily values are weighted by the count of distinct users for the day. * `stuckBgWakelockRate28dUserWeighted` (`google.type.Decimal`): Rolling average value of `stuckBgWakelockRate` in the last 28 days. The daily values are weighted by the count of distinct users for the day. * `distinctUsers` (`google.type.Decimal`): Count of distinct users in the aggregation period that were used as normalization value for the `stuckBgWakelockRate` metric. A user is counted in this metric if their app was doing any work on the device, i.e., not just active foreground usage but also background work. Care must be taken not to aggregate this count further, as it may result in users being counted multiple times. The value is rounded to the nearest multiple of 10, 100, 1,000 or 1,000,000, depending on the magnitude of the value. **Supported dimensions:** * `apiLevel` (string): the API level of Android that was running on the user's device, e.g., 26. * `versionCode` (int64): version of the app that was running on the user's device. * `deviceModel` (string): unique identifier of the user's device model.

Timelines have an aggregation period (`DAILY`, `HOURLY`, etc) which defines how events are aggregated in metrics.

Hourly aggregation periods, when supported by a metric set, are always specified in UTC to avoid ambiguities around daylight saving time transitions, where an hour is skipped when adopting DST, and repeated when abandoning DST. For example, the timestamp '2021-11-07 01:00:00 America/Los_Angeles' is ambiguous since it can correspond to '2021-11-07 08:00:00 UTC' or '2021-11-07 09:00:00 UTC'. Daily aggregation periods require specifying a timezone which will determine the precise instants of the start and the end of the day.

"description": "The decimal value, as a string. The string representation consists of an optional sign, `+` (`U+002B`) or `-` (`U+002D`), followed by a sequence of zero or more decimal digits (\"the integer\"), optionally followed by a fraction, optionally followed by an exponent. An empty string **should** be interpreted as `0`. The fraction consists of a decimal point followed by zero or more decimal digits. The string must contain at least one digit in either the integer or the fraction. The number formed by the sign, the integer and the fraction is referred to as the significand. The exponent consists of the character `e` (`U+0065`) or `E` (`U+0045`) followed by one or more decimal digits. Services **should** normalize decimal values before storing them by: - Removing an explicitly-provided `+` sign (`+2.5` -> `2.5`). - Replacing a zero-length integer value with `0` (`.5` -> `0.5`). - Coercing the exponent character to upper-case, with explicit sign (`2.5e8` -> `2.5E+8`). - Removing an explicitly-provided zero exponent (`2.5E0` -> `2.5`). Services **may** perform additional normalization based on its own needs and the internal decimal implementation selected, such as shifting the decimal point and exponent value together (example: `2.5E-1` <-> `0.25`). Additionally, services **may** preserve trailing zeroes in the fraction to indicate increased precision, but are not required to do so. Note that only the `.` character is supported to divide the integer and the fraction; `,` **should not** be supported regardless of locale. Additionally, thousand separators **should not** be supported. If a service does support them, values **must** be normalized. The ENBF grammar is: DecimalString = '' | [Sign] Significand [Exponent]; Sign = '+' | '-'; Significand = Digits '.' | [Digits] '.' Digits; Exponent = ('e' | 'E') [Sign] Digits; Digits = { '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9' }; Services **should** clearly document the range of supported values, the maximum supported precision (total number of digits), and, if applicable, the scale (number of digits after the decimal point), as well as how it behaves when receiving out-of-bounds values. Services **may** choose to accept values passed as input even when the value has a higher precision or scale than the service supports, and **should** round the value to fit the supported scale. Alternatively, the service **may** error with `400 Bad Request` (`INVALID_ARGUMENT` in gRPC) if precision would be lost. Services **should** error with `400 Bad Request` (`INVALID_ARGUMENT` in gRPC) if the service receives a value outside of the supported range.",
