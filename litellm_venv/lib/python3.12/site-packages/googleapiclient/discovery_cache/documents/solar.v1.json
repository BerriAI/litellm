More formally: Given `month` (1-12), `day` (1...month max; February has 28 days) and `hour` (0-23), the shade/sun for that month/day/hour at a position `(x, y)` is the bit ``` (hourly_shade[month - 1])(x, y)[hour] & (1 << (day - 1)) ``` where `(x, y)` is spatial indexing, `[month - 1]` refers to fetching the `month - 1`st URL (indexing from zero), `[hour]` is indexing into the channels, and a final non-zero result means \"sunny\".
