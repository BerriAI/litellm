Threat: Indicates a threat that is able to create new computational resources in an environment but not able to access data or execute code in existing resources.",

An example is a service account with access to more projects than it should have. If an actor gains access to the service account, they could potentially use that access to manipulate a project the service account was not intended to. Threat: Indicates a threat that is able to cause operational impact but may not access data or execute unauthorized code.",

An example is a database with weak or no passwords that is only accessible internally. This database could easily be compromised by an actor that had access to the internal network. Threat: Indicates a threat that is able to create new computational resources in an environment but not able to access data or execute code in existing resources.",
"Vulnerability: A medium risk vulnerability could be used by an actor to gain access to resources or privileges that enable them to eventually (through multiple steps or a complex exploit) gain access and the ability to execute arbitrary code or exfiltrate data. An example is a service account with access to more projects than it should have. If an actor gains access to the service account, they could potentially use that access to manipulate a project the service account was not intended to. Threat: Indicates a threat that is able to cause operational impact but may not access data or execute unauthorized code.",

An example is monitoring and logs being disabled for resource configurations and access.
