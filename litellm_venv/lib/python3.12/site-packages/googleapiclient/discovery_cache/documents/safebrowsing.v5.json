The expiration time then applies to every hash prefix queried by the client in the request, regardless of how many full hashes are returned in the response. Even if the server returns no full hashes for a particular hash prefix, this fact MUST also be cached by the client. If and only if the field `full_hashes` is empty, the client MAY increase the `cache_duration` to determine a new expiration that is later than that specified by the server. In any case, the increased cache duration must not be longer than 24 hours. Important: the client MUST NOT assume that the server will return the same cache duration for all responses. The server MAY choose different cache durations for different responses depending on the situation.",
