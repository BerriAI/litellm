Various cases include: - If `low` = `high`, the viewport consists of that single point. - If `low.longitude` > `high.longitude`, the longitude range is inverted (the viewport crosses the 180 degree longitude line). - If `low.longitude` = -180 degrees and `high.longitude` = 180 degrees, the viewport includes all longitudes. - If `low.longitude` = 180 degrees and `high.longitude` = -180 degrees, the longitude range is empty. - If `low.latitude` > `high.latitude`, the latitude range is empty. Both `low` and `high` must be populated, and the represented box cannot be empty (as specified by the definitions above). An empty viewport will result in an error.

The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a `region_code` with all remaining information placed in the `address_lines`.
