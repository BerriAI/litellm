"description": "Google's `RE2 `_ regex engine. The regex string must adhere to the documented `syntax `_. The engine is designed to complete execution in linear time as well as limit the amount of memory used. Envoy supports program size checking via runtime. The runtime keys ``re2.max_program_size.error_level`` and ``re2.max_program_size.warn_level`` can be set to integers as the maximum program size or complexity that a compiled regex can have before an exception is thrown or a warning is logged, respectively. ``re2.max_program_size.error_level`` defaults to 100, and ``re2.max_program_size.warn_level`` has no default if unset (will not check/log a warning). Envoy emits two stats for tracking the program size of regexes: the histogram ``re2.program_size``, which records the program size, and the counter ``re2.exceeded_warn_level``, which is incremented each time the program size exceeds the warn level threshold.",
