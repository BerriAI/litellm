Cursors can reference either the full ordering or a prefix of the location, though it cannot reference more fields than what are in the provided `ORDER BY`. Continuing off the example above, attaching the following start cursors will have varying impact: - `START BEFORE (2, /k/123)`: start the query right before `a = 1 AND b > 2 AND __name__ > /k/123`. - `START AFTER (10)`: start the query right after `a = 1 AND b > 10`.
