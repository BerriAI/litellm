"description": "An expression specifies a histogram request against matching resources (for example, jobs) for searches. Expression syntax is a aggregation function call with histogram facets and other options. Available aggregation function calls are: * `count(string_histogram_facet)`: Count the number of matching entity, for each distinct attribute value. * `count(numeric_histogram_facet, list of buckets)`: Count the number of matching entity within each bucket. A maximum of 200 histogram buckets are supported. Data types: * Histogram facet: facet names with format a-zA-Z+. * String: string like \"any string with backslash escape for quote(\\\").\" * Number: whole number and floating point number like 10, -1 and -0.01. * List: list of elements with comma(,) separator surrounded by square brackets. For example, [1, 2, 3] and [\"one\", \"two\", \"three\"]. Built-in constants: * MIN (minimum number similar to java Double.MIN_VALUE) * MAX (maximum number similar to java Double.MAX_VALUE) Built-in functions: * bucket(start, end[, label]): bucket built-in function creates a bucket with range of start, end). Note that the end is exclusive. For example, bucket(1, MAX, \"positive number\") or bucket(1, 10). Job histogram facets: * company_id: histogram by [Job.distributor_company_id. * company_display_name: histogram by Job.company_display_name. * employment_type: histogram by Job.employment_types. For example, \"FULL_TIME\", \"PART_TIME\". * company_size (DEPRECATED): histogram by CompanySize, for example, \"SMALL\", \"MEDIUM\", \"BIG\". * publish_time_in_day: histogram by the Job.publish_time in days. Must specify list of numeric buckets in spec. * publish_time_in_month: histogram by the Job.publish_time in months. Must specify list of numeric buckets in spec. * publish_time_in_year: histogram by the Job.publish_time in years. Must specify list of numeric buckets in spec. * degree_type: histogram by the Job.degree_type. For example, \"Bachelors\", \"Masters\". * job_level: histogram by the Job.job_level. For example, \"Entry Level\". * country: histogram by the country code of jobs. For example, \"US\", \"FR\". * admin1: histogram by the admin1 code of jobs, which is a global placeholder referring to the state, province, or the particular term a country uses to define the geographic structure below the country level. For example, \"CA\", \"IL\". * city: histogram by a combination of the \"city name, admin1 code\". For example, \"Mountain View, CA\", \"New York, NY\". * admin1_country: histogram by a combination of the \"admin1 code, country\". For example, \"CA, US\", \"IL, US\". * city_coordinate: histogram by the city center's GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude). For example, 37.4038522,-122.0987765. Since the coordinates of a city center can change, customers may need to refresh them periodically. * locale: histogram by the Job.language_code. For example, \"en-US\", \"fr-FR\". * language: histogram by the language subtag of the Job.language_code. For example, \"en\", \"fr\". * category: histogram by the JobCategory. For example, \"COMPUTER_AND_IT\", \"HEALTHCARE\". * base_compensation_unit: histogram by the CompensationUnit of base salary. For example, \"WEEKLY\", \"MONTHLY\". * base_compensation: histogram by the base salary. Must specify list of numeric buckets to group results by. * annualized_base_compensation: histogram by the base annualized salary. Must specify list of numeric buckets to group results by. * annualized_total_compensation: histogram by the total annualized salary. Must specify list of numeric buckets to group results by. * string_custom_attribute: histogram by string Job.custom_attributes. Values can be accessed via square bracket notations like string_custom_attribute[\"key1\"]. * numeric_custom_attribute: histogram by numeric Job.custom_attributes. Values can be accessed via square bracket notations like numeric_custom_attribute[\"key1\"]. Must specify list of numeric buckets to group results by. Example expressions: * count(admin1) * count(base_compensation, [bucket(1000, 10000), bucket(10000, 100000), bucket(100000, MAX)]) * count(string_custom_attribute[\"some-string-custom-attribute\"]) * count(numeric_custom_attribute[\"some-numeric-custom-attribute\"], [bucket(MIN, 0, \"negative\"), bucket(0, MAX, \"non-negative\")])",

Because values in `address_lines` do not have type information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (for example, \"Austin, TX\"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of address lines should be \"envelope order\" for the country or region of the address. In places where this can vary (for example, Japan), `address_language` is used to make it explicit (for example, \"ja\" for large-to-small ordering and \"ja-Latn\" or \"en\" for small-to-large). In this way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists of a `region_code` with all remaining information placed in the `address_lines`. It would be possible to format such an address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing a `region_code` and `address_lines` and then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities or administrative areas).",
