An ephemeral AES-256 wrapping key wrapped with the public_key using RSAES-OAEP with SHA-1/SHA-256, MGF1 with SHA-1/SHA-256, and an empty label. 2. The formatted key to be imported, wrapped with the ephemeral AES-256 key using AES-KWP (RFC 5649). This format is the same as the format produced by PKCS#11 mechanism CKM_RSA_AES_KEY_WRAP. When wrapping with import methods (RSA_OAEP_3072_SHA256 or RSA_OAEP_4096_SHA256), this field must contain the formatted key to be imported, wrapped with the public_key using RSAES-OAEP with SHA-256, MGF1 with SHA-256, and an empty label.",

"ImportJob": {
"description": "An ImportJob can be used to create CryptoKeys and CryptoKeyVersions using pre-existing key material, generated outside of Cloud KMS. When an ImportJob is created, Cloud KMS will generate a \"wrapping key\", which is a public/private key pair. You use the wrapping key to encrypt (also known as wrap) the pre-existing key material to protect it during the import process. The nature of the wrapping key depends on the choice of import_method. When the wrapping key generation is complete, the state will be set to ACTIVE and the public_key can be fetched. The fetched public key can then be used to wrap your pre-existing key material. Once the key material is wrapped, it can be imported into a new CryptoKeyVersion in an existing CryptoKey by calling ImportCryptoKeyVersion. Multiple CryptoKeyVersions can be imported with a single ImportJob. Cloud KMS uses the private key portion of the wrapping key to unwrap the key material. Only Cloud KMS has access to the private key. An ImportJob expires 3 days after it is created. Once expired, Cloud KMS will no longer be able to import or unwrap any key material that was wrapped with the ImportJob's public key.

"Policy": {
"description": "An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies). **JSON example:** ``` { \"bindings\": [ { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\", \"members\": [ \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\", \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\" ] }, { \"role\": \"roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\", \"members\": [ \"user:eve@example.com\" ], \"condition\": { \"title\": \"expirable access\", \"description\": \"Does not grant access after Sep 2020\", \"expression\": \"request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')\", } } ], \"etag\": \"BwWWja0YfJA=\", \"version\": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).",

Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits.

An integrity check of initialization_vector can be performed by computing the CRC32C checksum of initialization_vector and comparing your results to this field. Discard the response in case of non-matching checksum values, and perform a limited number of retries. A persistent mismatch may indicate an issue in your computation of the CRC32C checksum. Note: This field is defined as int64 for reasons of compatibility across different languages. However, it is a non-negative integer, which will never exceed 2^32-1, and can be safely downconverted to uint32 in languages that support this type.",
