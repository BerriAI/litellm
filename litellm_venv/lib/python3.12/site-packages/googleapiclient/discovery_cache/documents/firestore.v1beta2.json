Special characters in field paths that must be quoted include: `*`, `.`, ``` (backtick), `[`, `]`, as well as any ascii symbolic characters. Examples: (Note: Comments here are written in markdown syntax, so there is an additional layer of backticks to represent a code block) `\\`address.city\\`` represents a field named `address.city`, not the map key `city` in the field `address`. `\\`*\\`` represents a field named `*`, not any field.
