If these fields are modified in the same request, those values will be used instead of the link defaults. * Setting a link on a text range that overlaps with an existing link will also update the existing link to point to the new URL. * Links are not settable on newline characters. As a result, setting a link on a text range that crosses a paragraph boundary, such as `\"ABC\\n123\"`, will separate the newline character(s) into their own text runs. The link will be applied separately to the runs before and after the newline. * Removing a link will update the text style of the range to match the style of the preceding text (or the default text styles if the preceding text is another link) unless different styles are being set in the same request."
