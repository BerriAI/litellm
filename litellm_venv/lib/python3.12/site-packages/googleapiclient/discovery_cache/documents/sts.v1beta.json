"subjectToken": {
"description": "Required. The input token. This token is either an external credential issued by a workload identity pool provider, or a short-lived access token issued by Google. If the token is an OIDC JWT, it must use the JWT format defined in [RFC 7523](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7523), and the `subject_token_type` must be either `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt` or `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token`. The following headers are required: - `kid`: The identifier of the signing key securing the JWT. - `alg`: The cryptographic algorithm securing the JWT. Must be `RS256` or `ES256`. The following payload fields are required. For more information, see [RFC 7523, Section 3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7523#section-3): - `iss`: The issuer of the token. The issuer must provide a discovery document at the URL `/.well-known/openid-configuration`, where `` is the value of this field. The document must be formatted according to section 4.2 of the [OIDC 1.0 Discovery specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfigurationResponse). - `iat`: The issue time, in seconds, since the Unix epoch. Must be in the past. - `exp`: The expiration time, in seconds, since the Unix epoch. Must be less than 48 hours after `iat`. Shorter expiration times are more secure. If possible, we recommend setting an expiration time less than 6 hours. - `sub`: The identity asserted in the JWT. - `aud`: For workload identity pools, this must be a value specified in the allowed audiences for the workload identity pool provider, or one of the audiences allowed by default if no audiences were specified. See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.workloadIdentityPools.providers#oidc Example header: ``` { \"alg\": \"RS256\", \"kid\": \"us-east-11\" } ``` Example payload: ``` { \"iss\": \"https://accounts.google.com\", \"iat\": 1517963104, \"exp\": 1517966704, \"aud\": \"//iam.googleapis.com/projects/1234567890123/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/my-pool/providers/my-provider\", \"sub\": \"113475438248934895348\", \"my_claims\": { \"additional_claim\": \"value\" } } ``` If `subject_token` is for AWS, it must be a serialized `GetCallerIdentity` token. This token contains the same information as a request to the AWS [`GetCallerIdentity()`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_GetCallerIdentity) method, as well as the AWS [signature](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html) for the request information. Use Signature Version 4. Format the request as URL-encoded JSON, and set the `subject_token_type` parameter to `urn:ietf:params:aws:token-type:aws4_request`. The following parameters are required: - `url`: The URL of the AWS STS endpoint for `GetCallerIdentity()`, such as `https://sts.amazonaws.com?Action=GetCallerIdentity&Version=2011-06-15`. Regional endpoints are also supported. - `method`: The HTTP request method: `POST`. - `headers`: The HTTP request headers, which must include: - `Authorization`: The request signature. - `x-amz-date`: The time you will send the request, formatted as an [ISO8601 Basic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4_elements.html#sigv4_elements_date) string. This value is typically set to the current time and is used to help prevent replay attacks. - `host`: The hostname of the `url` field; for example, `sts.amazonaws.com`. - `x-goog-cloud-target-resource`: The full, canonical resource name of the workload identity pool provider, with or without an `https:` prefix. To help ensure data integrity, we recommend including this header in the `SignedHeaders` field of the signed request. For example: //iam.googleapis.com/projects//locations/global/workloadIdentityPools//providers/ https://iam.googleapis.com/projects//locations/global/workloadIdentityPools//providers/ If you are using temporary security credentials provided by AWS, you must also include the header `x-amz-security-token`, with the value set to the session token. The following example shows a `GetCallerIdentity` token: ``` { \"headers\": [ {\"key\": \"x-amz-date\", \"value\": \"20200815T015049Z\"}, {\"key\": \"Authorization\", \"value\": \"AWS4-HMAC-SHA256+Credential=$credential,+SignedHeaders=host;x-amz-date;x-goog-cloud-target-resource,+Signature=$signature\"}, {\"key\": \"x-goog-cloud-target-resource\", \"value\": \"//iam.googleapis.com/projects//locations/global/workloadIdentityPools//providers/\"}, {\"key\": \"host\", \"value\": \"sts.amazonaws.com\"} . ], \"method\": \"POST\", \"url\": \"https://sts.amazonaws.com?Action=GetCallerIdentity&Version=2011-06-15\" } ``` You can also use a Google-issued OAuth 2.0 access token with this field to obtain an access token with new security attributes applied, such as a Credential Access Boundary. In this case, set `subject_token_type` to `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token`. If an access token already contains security attributes, you cannot apply additional security attributes.",
