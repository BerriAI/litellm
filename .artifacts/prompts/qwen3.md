A startup tracks weekly active users: [1320, 1588, 1710, 1895, 2044, 2102, 1998, 2234]. Run the following Python exactly as provided, then summarise the largest spike and give a short recommendation. ```python users = [1320, 1588, 1710, 1895, 2044, 2102, 1998, 2234] changes = [((curr - prev) / prev) * 100 for prev, curr in zip(users, users[1:])] peak_change = max(changes) peak_week = changes.index(peak_change) + 2 # week numbering starts at 1 print({'changes': changes, 'peak_week': peak_week, 'peak_change': peak_change})  After the code runs, respond with one sentence that states the peak percentage change, the week number, and a concrete recommendation.
